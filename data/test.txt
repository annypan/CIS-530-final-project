In a shallow bowl, melt the chocolate in microwave for 2 minutes; stir.
NOTE: Be careful so that the temperature does not exceed 100 degrees F. If chocolate is not completely melted, return to microwave for 30 seconds at a time and stir until smooth.
Add corn syrup to the chocolate and mix well.
Using a rubber spatula, stir and fold mixture, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl well, until no shiny syrup is visible and the mixture forms a thick ball.
Pour mixture onto a waxed paper sheet and spread with the spatula until it's about 1/2-inch thick; let it sit and stiffen, uncovered, for about 2 hours.
Use at once or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.
TO MAKE CHOCOLATE ROSES: Knead a handful of clay at a time on a work surface until it is soft and pliable like Play-Doh.
Roll dough into twelve (12) 1/2-inch diameter balls of clay.
Place the balls on waxed paper or plastic wrap about 1-inch apart.
Using your fingers, press in the center and then on either side, flattening the disk into 1-inch flat disks about the size of a quarter (leave the top edge thinner than and bottom edge.
Repeat with the remaining disks.
Remove one disk and curl it into a "teepee" shape, narrow at the top and wider at the bottom, (this will be the center of the rose.
Wrap the next disk around the opening of the teepee and the third disk at the back of the teepee - this is the rose bud.
Continue adding disks which will look like petals.
Continue adding petals, placing them in between slightly lower than previous row.
For a fuller flower, continue adding petals in this manner.
As you form petals, you gently roll or curl the right edge of the petal downward.
Pinch off any excess chocolate clay at the base of the rose to make more balls.
NOTES: If the clay balls or petals become too soft from your body heat, let sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.
To periodically cool you hands, grasp a cold glass.
To make larger roses, make larger chocolate clay balls.

Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes until slightly thickened.
Hints for success: - Be sure to heat the griddle before pouring your pancake batter.
- Using a copper bowl to whisk the egg whites will give you more volume.
- Do not whisk the whites until they appear dry.
They should be stiff, yet moist.
- Fold the whites and the squash mixture gently.
If you over do it you will deflate the whites and have tougher, flatter pancakes.
- The syrup is rich and full of flavor.
You can make it the night before, refrigerate it and reheat the next morning.
- Use the freshest apple cider you can find.
If you use apple juice, try to use one that is not overly sweet.

** Bagel Success Hints
** When forming the bagels, set aside two 1/4" balls of dough.
When the bagels have doubled in size, drop the test dough into boiling water.
The dough should pop to the top right away.
When this happens, it is time to boil the bagels.
** A quick spray of non-stick vegetable coating on the top of the bagel may be substituted for the egg wash.
** To make bagel sticks, cut bagel before rising and lay out in a straight line.
Roll sticks in a combination of sesame and poppy seeds with a healthy pinch of garlic pwdr.
Let sticks rise, boil, and bake as described in the above directions.
** To make bagel chips, slice leftover bagels horizontally into thin slices.
Bruish with butter or possibly margarine on one side.

This recipe is really simple but it does take time.
Dont plan on using the butter the same day you start to make it, and dont rush yourself.
Make the butter at a leisurely pace whenever you have time, and refrigerate it when you are busy.
Pour the cream into an eight-ounce jar and add the chives and salt.
You could use more cream if you wanted, just adjust the size of the jar accordingly.
I used the leftover cream from when I made my Double Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache Cake.
I found that it made a nice proportion of butter to buttermilk but you could use heavy cream if so desired.
Seal the jar tightly.
Here is where the fun begins.
Shake the cream, and keep shaking, and shake some more, and still shake away.
By doing this you are created a little mini butter churn in your jar.
Shake while you are watching TV, really, just shake whenever you have at least one free hand.
It takes a long time to make butter this way.
But it still takes a long time if you wanted to try to use the mixer with a whisk attachment.
And my mixer whirs something awful.
Really I would rather shake a jar than listen to that thing for any prolonged period of time.
The butter is ready when you have about an inch to an inch and a half or more of butter and the butter looks kind of like scrambled eggs.
Take a small square of cheesecloth and place it over the mouth of the jar.
Flip over the jar and, holding on to the cheesecloth, let the buttermilk drain into a bowl.
Once most of the buttermilk is drained out, grab the cheesecloth and butter in one fist and squeeze out the remaining buttermilk.
Place the butter on a piece of plastic wrap and cover it before forming it into a ball.
Pour the buttermilk back into the jar.
Refrigerate both until ready to use.

Mix the ground almonds or pistachios and sugar in a bowl, and add just enough rose or orange-blossom water to bind them into a firm paste.
Put in less than you seem to require, as, once you start kneading with your hands, the oil from the almonds will act as an extra bind.
Alternatively, you can start with blanched almonds or pistachios and blend all the ingredients except the dates to a paste in a food processor.
Make a slit on one side of each date with a pointed knife and pull out the pit.
Take a small lump of almond or pistachio paste, pull the date open wide, press the paste in the opening, and close the date only slightly over it, so that the filling is revealed generously.
They keep well for weeks.

Thaw frozen dough, let rise, and bake dough all according to package directions- either for a loaf or rolls.
When the bread has baked and while still warm, combine margarine and honey well and spread liberally all over the top of the warm bread.
It should be glistening.
You may serve right away, or you may prepare earlier in the day and set the warm, glistening bread inside a resealable plastic bag.
It will stay very soft this way and can be reheated as desired later the same day.
Serve warm with real butter or more honey margarine mixture, as desired.
Note: Surprisingly, homemade doughs don't produce the same texture as the frozen doughs- so if you really want that restaurant taste, the purchased stuff is actually the way to go.



Sift the flour.
In a mixing bowl combine the flour, sugar, yeast and salt.
Mix well about 1 minute.
Pour olive oil and water.
Mix well.

Blend and pour over cabbage.



Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals on High (100%), stirring between heating.
Do not overheat.
The bowl should be almost cool to the touch.
Overheating will quickly cause the chocolate to burn.
Heat corn syrup in a separate microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) for 45 seconds.
Pour syrup into melted chocolate and stir with a rubber spatula until completely blended, about 30 generous folds of the spatula.
Make sure the spatula and bowl are scraped clean of white chocolate.
If any white chocolate has not made contact with corn syrup, you will have lumps in your finished modeling chocolate.
Watch for white chocolate streaks while you stir.
Mix until the streaks are gone.
Do not over-mix.
If you over-mix, you will notice your chocolate becoming crumbly and falling apart.
Line a quarter-sheet cake pan with a large sheet of plastic wrap, making sure there is plenty of overhang.
Pour chocolate mixture into pan and wrap the over-hanging plastic wrap around the chocolate.
Pull the plastic wrap straight and tight over chocolate.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature overnight.
The next day, cut the block of modeling chocolate into knead-able sections.
The block will be greasy.
It needs to be kneaded.
Dust a little cornstarch on the table to knead if chocolate is sticky.
If the block is too hard for you to knead, heat in microwave 5 seconds at a time until you can begin to easily press your fingers into the block with less force.
You will notice the block changing into a silky and pliable clay-like ball.
It will be a light ivory color after it is kneaded.
This is now Modeling Chocolate.
Cover with plastic wrap (Press-n-Seal is best) and drop in a resealable plastic bag for storage.
Store at room temperature for 3-4 months before the oils begin to dry out, or in the freezer for up to 2 years.
To color: Knead in gel paste or liquid paste color of any kind.
The water-based icing colors will be perfect for the job.
Start with a small amount, and add a little bit at a time until you get the color you want.
You can use pre-colored candy melts to make modeling chocolate, which is a helpful tip when you need several pounds of one color.
You can also pre-color your melted white chocolate before adding your corn syrup.
This recipe makes a lot.
I made roses and put them on top of cupcakes for a friend's birthday.
Enjoy.

Hints and Tips and how to make Challah:.
For a more golden crust mix 1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoons water and brush on bread just before placing in oven.
To tell doneness:.
Top will be springy and bottom will sound hollow if thumped.
Challah:.
( I will usually take aside two loaves and make into Challah to do this take two or one mound of dough, depending on how many Challah you want to make)
Per each mound of dough;
Take the mound of dough and separate into three relatively equal pieces make each piece into a long strands.
Now with your three long strands lay them length wise in front of you, take each piece at the top and pinch just the tips together.
Braid loosely like a hair braid and then pinch the ends again when done.
Tuck under the pinched edges.
Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet and cover lightly with a towel, lightly damp paper towel or lose tin foil.

Bon Appetit!



Makes 2 medium pizzas.
1.
Put the bread flour in a large bowl, stirring in the yeast and salt.
2.
Stir in the water gradually until a soft (but not sticky) dough forms.
Start with a cup of the water, and add up to 1/3 cup more as needed.
3.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 3 minutes, adding flour if the dough starts sticking to your hands or to the surface.
By the end of the 3 minutes, the dough should be very soft.
4.
Sprinkle the bowl with flour, put the lump of dough back in, and sprinkle the top of the dough with flour as well.
Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit in a warm place for 2 hours.
5.
An hour before youre ready to bake, heat the oven to 500 degrees F with a pizza stone inside, on the lowest rack (close to the element).
You want the pizza stone to heat up gradually with the oven.
6.
When the dough is done rising, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter and divide it into 2 pieces.
Flatten each piece into a disc and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
7.
Cut 2 large pieces of parchment paper, and shape one pizza on each piece of paper, trying to avoid using the rolling pin to extend the dough (which will squash out the desirable air bubbles).
If you want a nice thick crust along the edges, leave extra thickness around the perimeter.
Note: folding the crust over doesnt work as well as simply leaving a thick edge.
8.
Add the toppings you wanttomato sauce, veggies, cheeseleaving the crust area clear so that it will puff up in the oven.
9.
Slide the parchment paper pizza onto the hot baking stone and bake for 10-14 minutes, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.

Heat the milk to 185-190 degrees F in a non-aluminum cooking pot.
(I use a slow cooker on the high setting and just track the temp on a candy thermometer It takes about an hour and a half to do it this way, but it doesn't scald.
If you do this, you will need to pour the milk off into another vessel for the next step.
).
When the milk hits 185-190 degrees F, put the whole pot into a cold water bath where the water comes up on the outside of the pot to the same level the milk is at on the inside.
Watch it closely because the temp will drop like a stone.
When your milk hits 120 -125 degrees F on the thermometer, remove it from the waterbath.
Whisk in the yogurt with active cultures.
Put the cover on the pot (sometimes I pour it off into jars) and set it somewhere guaranteed to be over 100 degrees for 8 hours.
(Some folks use a slow cooker with a warming setting, some use an evaporator, others wrap the pot or jars in a heating pad -- there's a lot of ways you can do this.
In Texas, I just put it outside.
).
After 8-9 hours, your yo should have gurted (It'll look thick, you'll be able to see a separation of the whey from the milk -- etc.)
If your yo hasn't gurted, this means your culture either didn't take or died in the process.
To be sure you can leave it a bit longer but after 10 hours that yo is as gurted as it's going to get (if it doesn't work, the milk that isn't yogurt can be used in cooking.
).
If the yo has gurted, pour it into cheesecloth, potato sack cloth or muslin and strain the whey off with a collander.
Then tie the ends of the cloth together and hang it over the sink to allow the whey to drip off even more.
For store bought style yogurt, draining the whey takes about 15-30 minutes.
For Greek style yogurt, let it sit for about an hour to an hour and a half.
For, my favorite, which is roughly the consistency of smooth ricotta, let it go for two hours.
Stored in an airtight container, this stuff will hold up in the fridge for several days.

very versed in Judaism :-) ) ) ) Oh, and you are supposed to have meat too, but I do not know why.
She
I can think of two reasons for the meat.
One is simple - there is a old saying in Judaism (from the days when neither was more than weekly fare any way) - "There is no simcha [joy] without meat and wine."
Every meal in the sukkah should be a celebration (which's why I suggested bread with each meal.)
Another (and this is pure speculation) may harken all the way back to Temple days, when there would be massive, and ever-increasing, extra daily sacrifices during the week of Sukkot.
This is a pilgrimage festival as well, so Jerusalem would be filled with people.
It just makes sense which the extra meat (once the priests and Levites get their shares) would be distributed to the crowds.
I could easily be wrong - anyone know what happened to all the Sukkot sacrifices
One sharp pepper is better than a basketful of melons.
-Jewish Proverb

You can use it as a topping for Mont Blanc desserts too.
The sweet potatoes you get in Spain where I live are orange, so they look like this, but Japanese sweet potatoes will make a yellow chestnut coloured cream.
I tripled this recipe here, mixed it with 200 ml of whipped cream, and used it to decorate a cake.

loaf.
This recipe came with my Betty Crocker ABM and it's my favorite.
After reading the review, it prompts me to mention that I often take loaves out of my machine a little early because I don't care for hard crusts either.
I then take some milk and pour it over the sides of the bread, about 1 tbs.
at a time.
Butter works well too.
This softens the crust a little.



Stir together the rice, lentils and seasonings in a large saucepan.

).
Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the olive oil, oats and flour.
Turn the "meat" mixture into a lightly sprayed 9x13 casserole dish.
Spread the mixture evenly.
Cook at 300 degrees F for about an hour, turning every 15 minutes.
(Toward the end of the cooking time the top will begin to get a little crunchy so turning while it's cooking is important.
).
We've enjoyed this cooked on tortilla chips, mixed with penne and mushroom stroganoff, mixed with rice and wrapped in tortillas.
Basically, use it whenever you'd eat ground beef but you want a vegetarian twist.

Add cream cheese and blend until fully combined and smooth, about 30 seconds.
*Add vanilla extract and powdered sugar and blend on low speed until combined.
Increase to medium speed and beat until it begins to get fluffy.
*Slowly add the heavy cream, a little bit at a time until desired consistency is met.
(Dont add too much if you want the frosting to stay in place when piped on cupcakes.
).
*Beat until fluffy, about 1 minute.
*Use at once or keep refrigerated.
(This frosting will keep well in the refrigerator for several days, but you may need to re-beat it for the best texture.
).
The recipe above will produce a delicious VANILLA flavored frosting, here are a couple of other options to try....
For a Stronger Cream Cheese Flavor: Use an additional 4 oz.
( 1/2 block) of cream cheese.
This is good for any cake/cupcake recipe that is traditionally topped with Cream Cheese Frosting, like Carrot Cake, or Red Velvet Cake.
For Chocolate Frosting: (my favorite!)
add 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa (I use Ghirardelli brand, its really good).
Add the cocoa powder before adding the powdered sugar, so it gets fully incorporated into the butter and cream cheese.

Sterilize all equipment, if necessary.
I do not have to in my kitchen because I get a bubbly starter by Day 4.
The first step, whether or not you sterilize, is to scrub all pieces of equipment with hot water and dishwashing liquid, and dry with paper towels.
Then to sterilize, place the equipment in a large pot of boiling water for 5 minutes.
Lift it out of the pan with tongs and allow to dry on paper towels.
To begin starter, start early in the day.
Measure 1/2 cup distilled water into a sterilized bowl using a sterilized measuring cup.
Add 1 cup of organic flour, and stir with a sterilized spoon.
Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 12 hours.
After 12 hours, add in 1/2 cup distilled water and 1 cup organic flour, and leave again at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 12 hours.
DAY TWO:.
Wash and sterilize dry measuring cups and spoon again.
Add 1/2 cup distilled water and 1 cup of the organic flour to the starter and leave again at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 24 hours.
DAY THREE:.
Repeat step 4.
If the starter has not begun to bubble, wait one more day before discarding it.
DAY FOUR:.
If the starter is bubbling, repeat step four again, and transfer it to a larger sterilized bowl, before adding in flour and water.
If the starter has not begun to bubble by Day 4, discard and start over again.
DAY FIVE:.
Discard half of the starter and add 1 cup distilled water and 2 cups organic flour.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) until bubbly.
Refrigerate starter after it begins to bubble.
Maintenance:.
Feed the starter by removing it from the refrigerator, discarding half of it, and repeating step 6, once a week.
If any water separates out of the starter in between feedings, stir the water back inches After the starter is several weeks old, remove 1 cup and try feeding it with 1/2 cup ordinary tap water and 1 cup unbleached all purpose flour.
If it begins to bubble easily, continue to use tap water and unbleached all purpose flour on a weekly basis.

Sift together the strong flour and cake flour, then mix together with well chilled, 1 cm cubes of butter in a large bowl.
Do this by using your fingertips or scraper, but try not to melt the butter too much.
In the summertime, cut the pieces smaller and perform this step while chilling the bowl.
Stop mixing after the butter is broken down and crumbly.
Make a well in the middle, gradually pour the chilled water and fold in.
In the summer, use ice water.
After adding the chilled water, use the palms of your hands to roll the dough into a ball.
Do not knead the dough, and do not be concerned if it's not smooth--that will come later.
It should not have an even texture at this point, and the dough should appear slightly dry.
Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Roll out the dough until about half the height of the dough ball.
If it gets sticky, dust on some flour.
You should still see streaks of butter in the dough at this point, as in the second photo.
As you repeat the process of rolling and folding, the butter will blend and create layers and become flaky after baking the pie.
Fold the rolled out dough into thirds, turn it over, rotate it 90, and then roll it out again.
Repeat this process several times.
I repeat this 3 times.
Wrap in plastic wrap, then return it to the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 220C.
Roll the dough out to a size larger than your pie dish, then line the pie dish with the dough.
If time allows, it's best to let it rest for 30 minutes after this step.
If you are using a metal pie dish, rub with butter, then coat with strong flour.
Pierce the dough in several locations with a fork to ventilate, cover with parchment paper, then fill with baking stones.
Bake for 15 minutes at 220C.
Remove the baking stones, then bake the bottom.
Cover the edges with aluminum foil to prevent over baking.
Bake for about 7 minutes at 220C.
The pie shell is done.
Depending on the filling, pierce the base of the pie shell with a fork.
To make a country style pie, weave a layer of pie dough cut into 1 cm strips and lay it on top of the filling like a lattice.
Press down on the ends of the strips with the back of a fork, and brush on an egg wash. A ratio of more egg yolk than egg white will give a nice shiny finish.

Bring non-dairy milk of your choice and one minute cream of wheat to a simmer.
Stir constantly and simmer for about 1 minute.
Mixture will be thin and watery.
Add Vegan Chocolate Chips and Brown Sugar.
Stir until the chips and sugar are melted.
Add ground flax seed.
Stir just to blend.
Do not over stir or the mixture will become very thick.
If it becomes too thick add more milk of your choice.
Note: I usually use Almond Milk.
Soy Milk is my second choice, but I put Soy Milk in the ingredients because Recipezaar has nutrition facts for Soy Milk and not for Almond Milk.
Almond Milk is lower in calories and fat then Soy Milk.



Preheat oven to 350.
brown ground beef & drain excess fat.
mix taco seasoning into meat according to package directions.
in a separate pan, combine & warm soup, sour cream, & rotels.
Stir 2/3 of soup mixture into meat (consistency should be creamy without being runny).
fill tortilla's with beef mixture & roll enchilada style (both ends closed).
pour remaining soup mixture over enchiladas.
spread shredded cheese over all.
bake 20 minute to warm enchiladas thru & to melt cheese.



Mix first 2 ingred.
& let set overnight (or possibly for several hrs) tightly covered.
Add in cream & whip with heavy duty mixer or possibly by hand.
Divide dough into separate bowls.
(I divide into 3).
Makes nice batch of each.
For eachbowl, add in whatever color/flavor, etc you like.
Below are some ideas:
Vanilla cremes: add in vanilla****to taste.
Chocolate cremes: add in melted dark chocolate to taste.
Mint center: add in drops of peppermint oil & pink coloring.
Black Walnut center: add in drops black walnut oil & bl walnuts.
Peanutbutter cremes: add in smooth or possibly crunchy peanut butter.
Pineapple cremes: add in drops pineapple oil, minced candied pineapple & minced pecans.
Jelly: add in fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil w/creme center.
Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as filling; dip in white/tinted, or possibly lowfat milk chocolate.
Chocolate covered cherries
(cream type:) wrap creme center mix around a well-liquid removed marachino cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in choc.
*
Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge.
The acid in the cherry causes it to start cordialing (liquifying) quickly.
Will liquify some, but some will remain "creamy" because of the butter.
Coconut cremes: add in maccaroon coconut & drops or possibly coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1" balls, let crust over & dip in compound coating chocolate.
This is also called "dipping chocolate."
I prefer the brand "Merckens."
It seems to take more abuse/ reheating, or possibly getting too warm, etc.

Put the blueberry preserves into a quart-size heavy resealable plastic food bag and squeeze it into one corner.
Put the yogurt into the bag and squeeze it gently with your hands to lightly mix; swirls of blueberry throughout the yogurt are fine.
Arrange 6 mini paper drink cups on a small baking sheet.
Using scissors, cut about 1/2 inch off the corner of the bag and squeeze the swirled yogurt mixture into the cups, filling them about two-thirds full.
Gently insert a 6-inch lollipop stick into each cup.
The thickness of the yogurt should help the sticks stand upright.
Freeze for at least 2 hours before peeling off the paper cups and serving.

Puree rice and water together using immersion blender or Magic Bullet or similar.
Allow rice to soak in the water for some time.
Once the water is cooled you can put it in the fridge for days until an hour before you want to eat it.
Make sure that the mixture is liquid, adding more water if necessary, before cooling it.
1/2 to 1 hour before meal time, put rice in a pot and cook on a slow simmer, adding water as necessary.
1/2 hour will do, but 1 hour is better.
The more you stir, the creamier and yummier (and less stuck to the pot) it will be.



Mix yogurt, artichoke hearts, garlic powder, basil, and parsley together in a bowl.
Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.



In a storage container, combine both ingredients and set in the fridge for 24 hours.

Wash the fruits if necessary, and put them all in a large bowl.
Mix with the nuts and cover with water.
Add sugar to taste, and rose and orange-blossom water.
Let the fruits soak for at least 48 hours.
The syrup becomes rich with the juices of the fruit and acquires a light-golden color.
A less common version is to add dried figs and peaches, and a few fresh pomegranate seeds.
Their luminosity brings out the rich orange, mauve, and brown of the fruit, and the white and green of the nuts.
Some people dissolve amareldine (sheets of dried, compressed apricot) in the water to thicken and enrich it.
Putting 3 soaked apricots through the food processor with a little water will achieve the same effect.
Instead of macerating, you can cook the fruit with the nuts and almonds.
Simmer gently for about 1/2 hour.
It becomes a compote.



Mix dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Add optional spices, if desired.
Mix honey and warm water together, then add to dry ingredients, stirring just until mixed.
Pour into lightly oiled or non-stick 8-inch square baking dish.

Place the dried cherries in a coating pan attached to a stand mixer.
Spin at low speed.
Using a ladle, add the chocolate to the spinning cherries.
Add one ladleful at a time until the cherries are coated to the desired thickness.
(Use a 50/50 ratio (50 percent chocolate, 50 percent weight of the cherries.)
If a thicker coat is desired, use more chocolate and vice versa.
Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate).
There are a variety of ways to temper.
One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted.
Be very careful not to overheat it.
(The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip.
It will retain its shape even when mostly melted.
White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.)
Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat.
Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps.
Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl.
As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it.
A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.
Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding.
In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate.
The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount.
It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.
The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering.
Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface.
The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set.
This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature.
If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached.
This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.
A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife.
If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.



For this recipe you will need four 4-ounce ramekins.
Place them in a baking dish.
Bring a kettle of water to a boil and set aside.
You will use all of this to make a water bath when its time to cook the custards.
In a medium pot heat the milk, cream, peanut butter, and chocolate over medium heat.
Whisk until its all melted together and hot (but not boiling).
While youre waiting for the milk and cream mixture to heat, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, honey, salt and vanilla in a large bowl.
Once the milk mixture is hot, add about 1/2 cup to the egg mixture and stir.
This will temper the eggs and slowly warm them so you can add all of the milk mixture without scrambling them.
Repeat this with another 1/2 a cup of the milk mixture.
Finally, pour all of the egg mixture into the pot with the rest of the milk mixture, turn the heat to medium and, stirring continuously, heat the mixture until it is at 140 degrees.
Measure this with a candy thermometer.
Pour the custard through a fine mesh strainer to remove any solids.
Divide the custard evenly across the four ramekins.
Carefully pour the water you boiled into the dish with the ramekins.
Fill it about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the ramekins.
Cover the baking dish with foil and place it in the oven.
Bake them at 300 degrees for 30-45 minutes, or until set.
Theyll still jiggle a bit when they are set, which is how youll know theyre done.
Remove them from the oven and the baking dish to cool.
Once at room temperature, cover them with plastic wrap and store them in the refridgerator to chill for at least four hours before serving.
They will keep in the refridgerator for up to a week.
While the custards are chilling make the chocolate ganache.
Gently warm the cream over medium low heat until its hot and steamy.
Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl.
Pour the hot cream over the top of the chocolate and stir it all together until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
When ready to serve, pour a thin layer of chocolate over the top of the custards and, using a dinner knife, gently spread it around so its in an even layer.



Combine oats, milk, water, salt and 1/4 tsp cinnamon in a crock pot or slow cooker.

Add the remaining ingredients, stirring till the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, oil your hands, and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to become smooth and supple.
This is a stiff dough, but just keep working at it; itll become smooth and elastic.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise till puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.
Mixer Method: Combine the ingredients as directed above, using a flat beater paddle or beaters, then switch to the dough hook(s) and knead for 5 to 8 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise as directed above.
Bread Machine Method: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start.
Take a look at the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, and adjust its consistency with additional water or flour, as necessary, to produce a smooth, supple dough.
Allow the machine to complete its cycle.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and form it into a loaf.
Place the loaf in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan.
Cover the pan and let the bread rise for 1 hour, or until it's just crowned over the edge of the pan.
Bake the bread in a preheated 375F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until it's golden brown and its internal temperature is about 200F Note: This bread has a tendency to brown quickly (and underbake in the center), so plan on tenting it lightly with aluminum foil about 20 minutes before the end of the baking time.
Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.



Combine all of the ingredients.
Once they have blended together, it's done.
Please adjust the vinegar to taste.
This will of course go well with raw vegetables, but I think it goes even better with boiled veggies.

I may or may not know this from personal experience.
Pore the sauce over popcorn, ice cream, apples, brownies... or eat it with your fingers, whatever.
*Note: this recipe can be made with normal butter, it works just fine.



Combine all ingredients.
Mix thoroughly.
Store mixture in an airtight container.



Put the room temperature butter and vegetable oil in a bowl and mix well with a whisk until combined.
Add sugar in 2 batches, mixing well each time.
Sift the cake flour into the bowl and fold in with a rubber spatula.
After the flour is incorporated, use your hands to knead and bring the dough together.
Form into a cylindrical shape and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
If you want to make cut-out cookies, wrap the dough in plastic wrap without shaping it and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.
Slice the dough into 5mm - 1cm thick and bake in an oven preheated to 355F/180C for about 13 minutes.
Let the cookies cool completely, and they're done!
If you slice the dough thickly (1-1.5 cm), the crumbly texture will be even better!!
Hmm, I wonder how many times I've made these... this is one of my favorite recipes.



In a large pot, melt 1 tablespoon butter or margarine over medium heat: cook and stir vegetables and beef , until beef is brown.

1.
In a large bowl (or the bowl of your electric mixer), combine warm water, yeast, and 1/3 cup honey (do this with the dough hook if using mixer).
2.
Let the mixture sit about 5-10 minutes until bubbles have formed on the surface, it is frothy and you can definitely smell yeast.
If this does not happen after 10 minutes you may have old or dead yeast.
Start again with freshly bought yeast if this happens.
3.
Then add 5 cups whole wheat flour and stir (with a dough hook attachment) to combine.
Let the dough set for 30 minutes, or until big, bubbly and doubled in size.
4.
Next, mix in 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil (or olive oil if you dont have coconut oil), ground flax seed and salt.
Stir in 2 cups of all-purpose flour and mix with a dough hook gently until all the flour is combined.
This all-purpose flour amount is your variable.
You may need less flour, or more depending on where you live and the weather at the time.
I suggest starting at 1/2 cup and adding an additions of 1/2 cup until your dough has become a ball, and is not sticking to the sides while it is mixing.
If you decide to knead by hand, flour your work surface and knead it as you add in 1/2 cup increments of all-purpose flour until youve created a ball and the dough is not sticking to the counter.
5.
Place dough in a large greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.
Cover dough with a dishtowel.
Let it rise in a warm place until doubled.
6.
Preheat oven to 350 F. Punch down dough, and divide into 2 loaves.
Place dough into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow it to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.
7.
Bake at 350 F for 25 to 35 minutes.
Make sure to not over bake.
You want bread to be browned and hard to the touch.
Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter or coconut oil if youd like when done to prevent crust from getting hard.
Cool completely.
Enjoy!

1.
Heat the milk and cream over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches 185 degrees Fahrenheit.
Do not let the milk boil.
(Note: I saw little bubbles form on the surface at about 175 degrees, at which point I turned down the heat to medium, just to ensure the temperature didnt rush past 185 degrees or start to boil while I wasnt looking.)
(Another note: The surface of the milk will pucker while it heats.
Do not be afraid.
This is normal.
Feel free to skim it off if it freaks you out, but only do this right before the milk hits 185 degrees, because the skin will appear again very quickly.)
2.
When the mixture reaches 185 degrees, remove the pot from the burner and set on a cool surface.
Add the white vinegar immediately and stir gently for 30 seconds.

5.
Set the colander into the bowl.
Line the colander with several layers of cheesecloth.
6.
After the 2 hours has elapsed, gently scoop the curds into the center of the strainer.
Once youve gotten most of the curds out of the stockpot, pour the remaining liquid and curds into the colander.
Fun fact to know and tell the white liquid is called whey.
7.
Gather the cheesecloth at the top, and if youd like, fasten together with a rubber band/piece of twine/your kids hair ribbon.
Gently squeeze the curds to encourage draining of the whey.
Let the curds continue to drain for 30 minutes, gently squeezing a couple of times during the 30 minutes.

Pour the coconut milk into a small saucepan and heat over a medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes.
Watch the pan closely as once the coconut milk starts to boil it can bubble over quickly.
Keep whisking to prevent burning
Reduce the heat, bringing the coconut milk to a simmer, then add the sweetener, whisking until it's completely dissolved
Let simmer for 30 - 45 minutes or until the liquid is reduced by half.
It may take an hour so bear this in mind before starting.
Remove from the heat and let cool completely before using
This sweetened condensed coconut milk should last for at least a week when stored in a sealed glass jar in the fridge
I prefer using maple syrup as the sweetener but agave nectar, honey, coconut sugar, xylitol, granulated sugar etc are all fine to use.
Adjust accordingly
Just so you can see the difference, the coconut dulce de leche I posted is on the left, the coconut condensed is on the right.
It's paler in colour but nowhere near as smooth as the caramel is
If you need the condensed milk paler all you need to do is lower the heat and cook for longer, probably 2 hours



In a large bowl, place the warm water in first then the honey.

Instructions: Whisk all ingredients together.
Yep, that was hard, huh?
Okay, so this makes a lot of frozen yogurt.
Probably more than your ice cream maker can handle at one time.
It was about twice the amount my Cuisinart could handle.
So, I poured half of the prepared ingredients mixture into the ice cream maker and reserved the other half in the fridge until the first half was done.
I didnt even have to refreeze the bowl, it had enough oomph to freeze it all.
Snazzy, eh?
I love Cuisinart.
So, working quickly, spoon the frozen yogurt into a freezable container and store in the freezer until the next half of yogurt is done.
Also, I suppose you could reserve the other half of the unfrozen liquid in the frig until you were ready for it.
It took about 25-30 minutes for it to freeze in the ice cream maker.
Once all your yogurt is frozen, resist the temptation to eat it all and freeze it for several hours to let it ripen and finish freezing.
I just ended up leaving mine overnight.
The next day it was utter frozen yogurt perfection.
Its rich, its creamy, its tangy .
.
.
like the kind of yummy that makes you question why you ever thought it wasnt as good as ice cream.
Feel free to use this as a base for other flavor extracts or additions.
I think it would be awesome with a cup of fruit added to emphasize that tanginess like peaches or berries or mangoes or chocolate.

If you want saffron colour, put flowers of marigold in the water and boil them thoroughly.
Leave the water untouched overnight.
Next day, add it to the flour, powder and turmeric mixture.
If you want red colour, prepare a paste of hibiscus flowers mixed with a little water and add it to the flour mixture.
Alternatively, you may use powdered hibsicus flowers added with some water(made into paste) and then added to the flour mixture.
Alternatively, you may use beetroot boiled in water and left overnight and used the next day(add it to the flour mixture next day).

Whisk cornmeal and water in medium bowl to blend.
Bring milk and salt to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Gradually add cornmeal mixture, whisking constantly until polenta comes to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until polenta is very thick, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Mix in maple syrup and butter.
Season to taste with pepper and transfer to bowl.



Put flour, sugar, and salt into large bowl and mix lightly.
Add yeast and water, then knead together ingredients with hands.
The dough will be sticky at first.
Once you have combined the ingredients into a manageable dough, take out the dough onto a flat kneading surface.
Knead dough firmly with your hands until the dough is no longer lumpy and powdery, approximately 15min.
Add sprinkles of water or flour as necessary to keep the dough manageable -- it will get elastic but pretty stiff.
Cut dough into 6 pieces.
Shape each piece into a ball.
Cover with plastic wrap or a damp paper towel to prevent drying.
Shape the dough.
You can either poke a hole in the middle with your finger and stretch out into a bagel shape or roll out the dough into a rope and tie the ends together.
The dough will expand, so leave a nice big hole in the middle.
Cover the bagels with plastic wrap and let rest for about 15 minutes (30-40 min during winter time).
In the meantime, fill a large pot with water and a teaspoon of sugar or honey and bring to a simmer.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
When the dough is ready, carefully drop them into the water and let them simmer for about 15 seconds on each side, flipping them only once.
The bagels should float.
Keeping the water boiling too hard or flipping too much will cause the surface of the bagels to crinkle later.
I usually boil two at a time.
Take the bagels out with a slotted spoon and blot excess water.
If you would like to add toppings, do so now.
For small or crumbly toppings such as sesame and poppyseed, dump out the toppings on a small plate and gently press the top of the bagel into the topping.
Put the bagels onto a baking sheet and let bake until brown, approximately 15 minute.
Note: You can use whole wheat flour and even ingredients such as cocoa, pureed spinach, pureed pumpkin/cinnamon/nutmeg to make different kinds (and different colors!)
of bagel dough.
Be sure to decrease the amount of added water accordingly -- I would try making the plain first to get an idea of what the dough should feel like.

Put ingredients into bread pan in the order suggested by the manufacturer of the bread machine.
If you're going to use a timer, it is vital to keep the yeast away from both the liquids AND the salt.
I make this on the white bread cycle and it comes out great, but you may wish to use the whole wheat cycle.
I never noticed any difference except that the whole wheat cycle took a lot longer.
Your machine may yield different results, tho.
If you like crusty bread, just let the finished bread set on a rack to cool.
If you want a softer crust, slip the hot bread into a plastic bag so that the crust will get steamed and be nice& soft- and good for sandwiches.



Toss all ingredients in large bowl mixing thoroughly.
Chill before serving.
Note:.
Boil chicken in water for 30 minutes with a few chunks of onion, carrot and celery.
One large chicken will yield about 4 cups of meat.
If you prefer only white meat, use breasts only.
When cooled remove chicken from bone, chop into pieces no bigger than a 1/2 an inch.



Cook Potatoes and mash with butter.
Beat cream cheese and sour cream and salt until light and fluffy.
Add potatoes and chives and stir.
Cooked in greased 9x13 dish at 350 for 20-25 minutes.



In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice with the olive oil and the flax oil.
Whisk in the honey.
Add more if you like your dressing to be sweeter.



Heat up a small bowl (I just run hot water over it).
Put the honey, brown sugar, water into bowl and sprinkle yeast in and set aside for 10 minutes.
In the meantime, mix all dry ingredients well in large bowl and then mix in butter (I did this with my hands -- it was fun!
).
Make a well in the center and pour yeast mixture into it, then stir well.
Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead lightly for 5-7 minutes, incorporating the extra flour bit by bit.
Add as little possible flour to work with it, the dough will feel semi-sticky.
Knead into a ball and set in a large greased bowl and turn to grease the dough.
Let rise 1 hour.
Punch down dough and shape into loaf (knead lightly).
Put into lightly greased loaf pan and let rise 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 until internal temperature is 180-190 (about 45 minutes).
Temperature is very important when making yeast bread so make sure you use a thermometer whenever a temperature is listed, and a temperature gauge for your oven is ideal as well.
My oven heats a whole 100 more than the dial says!



Preheat oven to 300 degrees (150 C.).
After you have sifted the flour, measure out 1 cup (225 ml), by spooning the flour into the 1 cup (225 ml) measuring cup and leveling it off with a knife.
Then take the flour, cornstarch and powdered sugar and sift together into a large mixing bowl.
Add the butter and take your hands, (clean hands), and mix it all together until it forms a ball.
(Note: sometime I add a little more sifted flour to this mixture if it is real sticky) Then clean off your hands back into the mixing bowl getting as much of the mixture off of your hands and back into the bowl as you can.
Then I cover the bowl and put it into the refrigerator and let it cool down again.
Then when I am ready to bake, I cool my hands down and take and pinch off a piece of dough and roll it into about a 1 inch ball.
Place the cookie ball onto an ungreased, cookie sheet or jelly roll pan.
Place them about 2 inches apart.
Then take a fork and flatten the dough balls.
(Note: sometime I have to keep dipping the fork into flour to help keep the fork from sticking, and sometimes it still does.)
Bake in the oven for about 20 to 22 minutes.
Take them out and place on a cooling rack for about 10 minutes, then carefully take a spatula and remove them one by one onto another close woven cooling rack to finish cooling.
Store in a air tight container.



Pack the spinach into a microwave safe measuring cup or bowl and add a small amount of water (about 1 tablespoon).
Cover and cook for 3 minutes on high, or until spinach is cooked.
All microwaves are a bit different.
It took 3 minutes in mine, but yours may be more or less than that.
Allow spinach to cool slightly, then squeeze out the excess water and coarsely chop it.
Place the spinach, flours, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until well combined and the spinach is finely chopped.
Add the lard (or whichever substitute youre using) and pulse until the mixture is crumbly.
Then, while the food processor is running, slowly pour in the hot water until the dough forms a ball.
If your dough still looks dry and isnt forming a ball, add more hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together.
Remove the dough from the food processor and divide it into 8 equal pieces on a lightly floured counter top.
Cover with a clean tea towel and allow dough to rest for 10-30 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Roll out one dough ball at a time on a floured counter top until it is very thin.
If the dough is springing back and not holding its shape, let it rest for another 5 minutes and try again.
It should roll out easily.
Make sure to move it around and flip it over while you roll it out to prevent sticking.
Put a tortilla into the hot skillet.
Cook it for 15-20 seconds per side, flipping it with a rubber spatula when bubbles form and are lightly browned.
You may need to lower the heat if theyre cooking too quickly.
Stack the tortillas on a plate after you cook them and cover with a damp tea towel.
Use immediately, or store them in an airtight plastic bag in the refrigerator once they cool.
They can also be frozen.
Heat briefly in the microwave before using to make them more pliable.
Note: 1.
This recipe requires 1/2 cup of cooked, chopped spinach, which was 4 packed cups of fresh spinach for me.
2.
You could also make these fully whole wheat, or fully all-purpose flour.
I did 1/3 whole wheat for the ones in the pictures though.
3.
Also, you can replace the lard with shortening, butter, or even coconut oil if you like.
I change up which I use depending on my mood and what I have on hand.
I think lard is the most traditional for tortillas, but Ive used all of them and they all work well, so use whichever you prefer.

Bake two of these sponge cakes to make a layered birthday cake.
Spread maple syrup on top of the bottom layer, then whipped cream and strawberries.
Next, place the top layer of sponge cake on top and coat with whipped cream, decorated with sliced strawberries and cut kiwi fruit.
Please feel free to decorate as you like.
You may use any kind of vinegar, such as grain vinegar or rice vinegar, but based on my experience, apple cider vinegar came out tasting the best.
At first, when you add the vinegar, the smell is strong enough to make you wonder if it's really okay, but once it is baked, the smell disappears, so don't worry.
Here it is as a Christmas cake decorated together in 2006.
And again as a birthday cake in 2007.
The sweetness is milder than regular sponge cakes, and was a hit.

Leave for 20 min to "set the sponge".
When this time has elapsed, begin mixing (or possibly kneading with the dough hook if using a mixer).
Add in 2 c. of the water, check for texture, and add in the rest if necessary.
Knead vigorously.
If using a dough hook, somewhere about 10 min into the process the dough will suddenly change texture and require more flour.
Add in it (probably about another 150 g).
Turn the dough into an oiled bowl to rise.
The texture will be somewhat sticky.
After allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hrs, turn out of the bowl, punch down, and divide into two loaves.
Turn into nonstick pans (or possibly greased ones) and allow to rise for another hour.
Bake at 220C for 35 min.
Turn out of the pans and allow to sit in the still-warm oven upside down for 5 min to harden the crusts.
Let sit overnight before cutting.

If youre not cooking them now, place the potato wedges in a bowl full of cold water.
If you are cooking them now, dry them off completely with a paper towel or kitchen towel.
In a medium-large bowl, use your hands to toss the potatoes with the canola oil, enough to cover every wedge completely.
Season with salt.
Mix well.
Spread out potatoes on an aluminum half-sheet pan, making sure theyre in a single layer.
Use 2 pans if you need to.
Place in the preheated oven and bake, stirring occasionally, for at least 25 minutes.

Starting with just the tomatoes place half the tomatoes and juice in food processor and process until a fairly small texture, but not pureed.
Repeat with second half.
Then process all the onions and the jalapenos in a single batch.
I do all of this with an electric food grinder instead of a food processor and I use the 1/8-inch plate to get the correct ground texture and size, but a food processor will give you the same results.

Wash about 10 pounds of beets very well with a vegetable brush under cold running water to remove all remaining garden dirt.
Do not peel or cut off the tails; leave about an inch of stem.
The skins, tops and tails will slip off later when they are cooked.
Place beets in a large stock pot and cover with cold water.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to keep at a gentle boil for about 1 hour or a little longer if the beets are very large.
I prefer to use the small tender ones that cook quickly and evenly.
At this point, you have 1 hour to put your washed bottles (I like to use wide-mouthed 1-pint jars) in a pot of simmering water, the lids and rings in another pot, and to prepare the brine (see directions below).
Be sure that you keep everything you use in a sterile condition.
When the cooking time is up, carefully place the hot pot in the sink and run cold water in until the beets are just cool enough to handle (better that they are on the hot side to maintain a level of sterilization).
Note: do not assembly line this job.
You must work one jar at a time to keep things hot and clean.
WORK QUICKLY.
Place 4 whole cloves in the bottom of the jar, then slide beets out of their skins by rubbing gently in your fingers.
Drop beets into the jar.
If the beets are tiny, they can go in whole.
Otherwise, cut them into bite-size pieces.
When the jar is full to within 1 inch of the top, pour on the boiling hot brine to just cover the beets.
Wipe the jar rim with a clean damp paper towel and cover with a sterile cap and ring.
Tighten the ring and set jar aside to cool.
Repeat the above step until you are out of beets.
As the jars cool, you should be able to hear them pop and seal.
Any that dont seal must be refrigerated and eaten within a couple of months.
To prepare the brine, combine white vinegar, 1 cup water, and sugar.
Bring to a rolling boil.
After sugar is dissolved, reduce heat but keep at a low boil in a covered pot.
I have an large old Corningware coffee pot that I keep for this job.
It has a spout and a handle, so its easy to pour boiling liquid.
A few tips:
1.
Fresh beets from the farmers market in the sumer give the best results.
Ones that have been in storage for half the year are tough and fibrous.
2.
Clean up your work space beforehand so nothing is in your way.
3.
Have everything you need washed and ready to use.
4.
Cut a little stack of paper towels in quarters.
Use a fresh piece to wipe each jar rim and have a bowl of water beside them to dampen them.
5.
If you wear a pair of good-fitting surgical gloves to peel the beets, you wont have purple fingers for three days after.
6.
Have your whole cloves on a small plate ready to use when needed.

Turn it on and let it do its thing.
When its done, put the rice in a shallow bowl and drizzle with the vinegar solution.
With a spatula, fold the rice to incorporate.
Do not stir or mix because the grains will get smashed and the rice will become mushy.
This is not what we are going for here.
Spread the hot rice out on a cookie sheet and fan to cool it down.

Combine the grapes, water, and sugar in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a slow boil, then simmer until the grapes have broken down, about 1 hour.
As they cook, gently mash the grapes with a slotted spoon to help them release their juices.
Your kitchen will begin to smell like grape-flavored bubble gum: this is a good sign.
Once the grapes have surrendered most of their juices and begun to look more like raisins, remove from the heat.
Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the grape carcasses and transfer to a fine-mesh sieve set over a large bowl.
Pour the juice over the grapes and press down on them to get every last bit of juice out of them.
(We compost the remaining skins, seeds, and stems.)
Use the grape juice right away, or store it in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 1 week or in your freezer for up to 1 year.
Concord grape juice is used in Concord Grape Jelly (page 190).

Wipe the basil with a damp paper towel.
Since I'm lazy, I usually wrap the basil in the paper towel and very very gently rub the leaves.
Place all of the ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.
Transfer to a sterilized bottle and pour in some olive oil (not included in ingredients) to cover the surface of the sauce.
This can keep in the refrigerator for about 1 week.
If you want to freeze it, put it into a plastic storage bag with a seal, and flatten it out.
Whenever you want to use it, just break off the amount you want.
It's so easy!
Since this is just a simple pasto sauce, you can add garlic or cheese, etc.
depending on what dish you'll be using it in.

Preheat the oven to 350F (175C).
Line a baking sheet with foil, spread the oats evenly on the sheet, and bake for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice while baking, until the oats are fragrant and nicely toasted.
Remove from the oven.
Spread the sugar in a medium, heavy-bottomed skillet and cook over medium heat, watching it carefully.
When it begins to liquefy and darken at the edges, use a heatproof spatula to stir it very gently, encouraging the heat of the liquefied sugar around the edges to moisten and melt the sugar crystals in the center.
Tilt the pan and stir gently until all the sugar is melted and the caramel begins to smoke.
Once the mixture is deep golden, remove it from the heat and immediately add the oats to the skillet (lift the foil to guide them in quickly).
Return the foil to the baking sheet.
Stir the oats gently but quickly, coating them with the caramel.
Scrape the oats onto the foil-lined baking sheet and spread them as well as possible.
Sprinkle with the salt and let cool completely.
Once firm, break the pralined oats into small pieces by pulsing them in a food processor or placing the pieces in a heavy-duty plastic bag and smacking them with a mallet or rolling pin.

Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter which is no longer available.
A sheep pattern can be made out of cardboard and placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife.
Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her recipe for shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep.
Betty uses a sheep cookie cutter to make these cookies.
She suggests using your fingertips to dimple the dough to resemble their wooly coats.
If you like, a small piece of chocolate can be used for eyes after baking.

1.
Preheat oven to 375*F. Grease 24 mini-muffin cups.
2.
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup margarine, and nutmeg in a large bowl.
Stir in the milk, then mix in the baking powder and flour until just combined.
Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about half full.
3.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
4.
While muffins are baking, place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl.
In a separate bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon.
Remove muffins from their cups, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture.
Let cool and serve.
My Note: I was curious about a couple of things about this recipe.
First, why did I end up with 24, not 12, of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates?
Could it be that I misprint?
Mine is a standard, mini-muffin tin.
Second, I really don't like nutmeg much.
So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?!
And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth?
Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're small you won't eat as much.
You'll just eat more of them.
And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS, Dianne!
That way you get more of that buttery, cinnamony sweetness in every bite!
I did make a couple of modifications, but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe.
I used butter instead of margarine and, because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use, I subbed buttermilk for the milk.
This worked beautifully, but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1/2 teaspoons baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly!
Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up!
(And I already did, with five of them) Your recipe is a beauty, Dianne!
~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies, sometimes significantly!
This explains the variance in yield with this recipe, to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins.
This recipe makes 24 mini muffins.
You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin.
You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish, but "officially" this recipe makes 24.
I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side.
Sorry about the confusion!
I dare you to eat just one -- With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long.
I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out.
I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe.
I put in a little less than 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.
I also coated mine in powdered sugar, vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze.
We all like the vanilla glaze best!
Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 TBS milk 1 TBS butter, softened Put that into a bowl and mix together.
I added more milk, but I didn't measure.
I just got it to the consistancy I liked.
Once I mixed it, I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed.
Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry.
I double dipped them.
Then on the vanilla glaze ones, I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze.
Also, glaze them once they have cooled.
If you don't wait, they will fall apart.



Whisk vinegar and sugar together.
Whisk in the oil until the dressing is well blended and emulsified.

Shake well before using.



The night before you plan to grill, combine the rub ingredients in a bowl.
Apply about one-third of the rub evenly to the ribs, reserving the rest.
Place the slabs in a plastic bag and refrigerate them overnight.
Before you begin to barbecue, take the ribs from the refrigerator.
Sprinkle the ribs lightly but thoroughly with rub, reserving the rest of the mixture.
Let the ribs sit at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.
Smoke the ribs, or grill them, turning and sprinkling them with more dry rub about halfway through cooking.
In the last 45 minutes of cooking, slather the ribs once or twice with Struttin' Sauce (recipe posted separately).
Allow the ribs to sit about 10 minutes before serving with more sauce alongside.
Note: cooking time is approximate grilling time.
Since not everyone has a smoker, I allowed for that -- smoking will take much longer.
I also like to parboil the ribs a bit before grilling as it makes them more tender -- obviously before marinating and applying any rub.



Combine all of the ingredients and mix well.
To use: rub mixture on your choice of meat--this is really most excellent on steak.
Use more for more flavor, less if you don't want it as spicy.

blackberries or grapes per 5 gal.
vat.
Pour juice and pulp into a 5 gallon vat.
Crush 5 Campden tables and dump into vat.
Dump 5 teaspoons of Pectic Enzyme into vat.
Fill the vat with water up to the indented 5 gallon mark, which is about 4 or 5 inches from the top.
Stir the mixture well and secure the lid and while pressing down to get as much air out as possible, cover the hole with scotch tape.
Empty 1 package of wine yeast into a small glass half filled with water and place 2 teaspoons of orange or lemon juice into glass.
Stir well and cover with saran wrap or plastic wrap, setting this aside over night.
The next day, slowly dump the yeast mixture into the vat near one place at the edge.
Make sure all of the yeast mixture gets into the vat.
Do not stir at this time, as you want the yeast mixture to remain in one small area.
Secure the lid and place the air lock into the hole thru the scotch tape and press down on the lid to expell the air from the vat.
The next day begin stirring the wine twice a day, always replacing the lid and pressing out the air in the same manner.

Let stand 3 weeks and then begin to rack the wine every 30 days.
Racking is siphoning the wine into another vat, being careful not to siphon any of the sediment from the bottom, even if it means that you lose a little of the juice.
By doing this every 30 days, the wine will become clearer.
After about 4 or 6 months of racking, test the sweetness and add as much additional sugar as you require.
At this time, also 1/2 oz.
of Potassium Sorbate, which stops the fermenting process, and 5 teaspoons of Sparkolloid to the wine and stir.

Pick up the ends of the waxed paper and, using it as a sling, transfer the corn to a heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Making the soup: Add in 3 c. of lowfat milk and the salt to the saucepan.
Turn the heat to medium-high and stir often till the lowfat milk begins to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, so the lowfat milk simmers, but does not boil.
Simmer for 15 min, stirring every few min.
Finishing the soup: If you want a crunchy corn soup, just add in the remaining 1 1/2 c. lowfat milk, taste and add in more salt if needed; heat and serve.
If you want creamy corn soup, pour the soup into a food processor and process till the corn is pureed (the kernels will be broken down into small bits, or possibly blended completely into the lowfat milk, depending on how powerful your processor is).
Pour the soup back into the saucepan and add in the remaining 1 1/2 c. lowfat milk.
Taste and add in more salt if needed; heat and serve.

Wash and scald crock.
Remove soiled outer leaves from cabbage but do not wash the heads (the wild yeast on the unwashed cabbage are a factor in the fermentation process).
Shred the cabbage directly into the crock using a kraut shredder or mandolin so that it is not necessary to handle the cabbage.
The shreds should be long and about the thickness of a nickel, 1/16".
If cut too thinly, sauerkraut is soft and mushy; if too thickly, it is unattractive in appearance.
Sprinkle a layer of salt over each 1" layer of cabbage.
Pack each layer down well, using a potato masher or glass jar.
When all the cabbage and salt are in the jar, cover with a clean white cloth; place an inverted plate on the cloth and top with as large a piece of limestone as possible.
The weight of the stone holds the cabbage under the brine that soon forms and the small amount of lime that is dissolved by the brine aids in the lactic acid fermentation which gives sauerkraut is distinctive flavor.
Allow to ferment from one month to six weeks in a cool place, preferably at a room temperature of 60F (basement, for example).
A higher temperature speeds fermentation but the kraut is subject to spoilage.
Skim off any film that may have formed during the fermentation period.
The sauerkraut may be left in the crock for several months if care is taken that the brine always covers the kraut and that the film is removed eachtime the crock is opened.
Use a clean cloth each time the crock is covered.

Cut each piece into 4 or 5 equal pieces, each about the size of a medium walnut (3/4 to 1 ounce each).
Using both hands, roll each piece against the board until it forms a 12 to 14 inch rope.
Do not flour the board; the stickiness helps the dough stretch out.
Place the rope on the baking sheet, rolling it to coat with oil.
Spaced 1/2 inch apart, each sheet should hold 10 to 12 breadsticks.
When all the breadsticks are made, coat with sesame seeds: pour the seeds into a long narrow pile, as long as the bread sticks and twice as wide.
Starting with the first breadstick (which will be most relaxed and easiest to work with), roll each breadstick in the sesame seeds, coating well, then return it to the sheet pan.
Sprinkle each with a bit of kosher salt and let rest 10 minutes.
Bake 14-20 minutes.
Halfway through, turn each sheet pan 180 in the oven, and swap racks, to ensure even browning.

First, peel that ginger.
(I find the quickest and least wasteful way to peel ginger is with the side of a teaspoon.
Holding the teaspoon at a slight angle and with the back of the spoon facing you scrape down the ginger.
The skin comes off so much easier.)
Now chop it into small dice.
Cover your ginger with the 3 cups of water and simmer over medium heat, with the lid on, for 20 minutes in a LARGE saucepan*.
It will still feel quite firm at this stage.
Strain into a jug, catch all of the ginger pieces in your strainer and reserve all the liquid.
Put 2 1/2 cups of the reserved liquid and 2 1/2 cups sugar in the saucepan and add back in the ginger pieces.
Bring this mix up to a rolling boil and keep it there until your sugar thermometer reaches 106C or 225F.
(This stage is likely to take longer than you think.
I find that it quickly nearly reaches the temperature but takes a good ten minutes to actually hit 225F/106C.
Watch it though.
Once it reaches the correct temperature take it off the heat.
Strain the ginger straight away while it is still hot (reserving the syrupy liquid for your lattes and ice-cream) and toss the ginger pieces into more sugar until they are coated.
Let cool then keep in the fridge.
(My crystallized ginger is pink because I had less sugar in the house than I thought and ended up using my experimental batch of rose scented sugar).
(I also want to add just two things.
1) Please be careful when working with any hot liquid but especially hot sugar and 2) * Use a much bigger pan than you think you will use.
When the sugary water comes to a rolling boil it will at least triple in size.
A bigger pan will educe the risk of spills and burns.)

Place salt away from the yeast, then pour the water aiming at the yeast.
Start mixing the yeast and honey with the water, gradually start kneading by incorporating the flour into the dough.
It should take about 15 minutes.
(If using a bread machine, set it to the dough cycle.
Follow the Steps 3 through 7, skip Step 8 and move to Step 9.)
Once the dough becomes smooth and does not tear when you stretch it, divide it into quarters then place on to a pan, seam side down.
(Close the seam by pinching it tightly with fingers).

Preserving the Starter: Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.
For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.
Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator.
Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days.
Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.
Whisk until blended but not smooth.
Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator.
If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container.
Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it.
Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water.
Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using.
CAUTION: Never keep your starter tightly closed!
The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!

Put flour in a large bowl with half the water.
Blend the two together until it holds.
Beat and knead well until it forms a compact ball.
Knead dough until it is smooth and elastic.
Set aside for 30 minutes.
Knead and divide dough into 4 to 6 parts.

Turn again and cook the first side pressed lightly with a towel.
It should puff.
Serve warm (maybe slightly buttered).



Stir together water, yeast, sugar and 2 tablespoons flour.
Leave to stand for 15 minutes in a warm position.
At the end of 15 minutes this should have about 2 inches of froth on top.
In a large bowl put in 8-10 cups plain flour.
Add a pinch of salt and stir.
Make a well in centre and add the yeast mixture.
Gradually stir in flour but don't add too much flour at once - a light hand is the story.
When the liquid has absorbed as much flour as necessary for it to be kneaded place on a floured board (in my case on1y plain paper) and knead until you can sit the dough in the palm of hand.
Spread some plain flour on a baking board.
Let this stand for 15 minutes -- this is the working time for the yeast and the dough should be nice and spongy and fluffy.
As soon as I have let the dough stand for 15 minutes I prepare my cooking pot.
Sufficient lard, dripping, cooking oil or tallow to cover at least 1/3 of cooking utensil.
Heat until blue smoke rises (for us in NZ on electric store this takes 15 minutes).
Cooking tip: If the fat does not smoke at end of 15 minutes add a wee bit of used fat -- new fat takes forever to reach the required temperature.
Again!
Don't worry overly much about the dough.
If it fluffs up nice and spongy and fat is not ready to fry bread, then just knead the dough again and let stand, but perhaps for only 10 minutes this time.
All things being equal, the dough and the fat should be ready together by this time.
So press the dough out (add flour if the board is sticky).
Cut into required (triangles, squares, etc) shaped, pressing to about 1/4 inch thick.
Fry one side, then brown fry other side and there is your bread.
Well, hope you enjoy your cooking and eating.

Success Hints: To develop the crisp crust that French Bread is known for, use your French cycle.
If your machine doesn't have a French cycle, simply start your machine and let it go through the first knead, then stop and restart it from the beginning again.
This gives the bread extra kneading time and results in a crisp crust.
Because of the distinctive chewy French crust, it is recommended that this bread is served within 24 hours to avoid toughness.
This recipe can be made using the regular, rapid and delayed time bake cycles.

Bring the bowl over to a stand mixer with dough hook attachment and begin to pour in the water, a little bit at a time, as you start up the mixer.
Knead the dough until you get a nice shiny ball of dough.
Spray a large round tray pizza tray works best with vegetable oil.
Oil up your hands and begin to break off 1/6 of the dough that you prepared.
Form the piece of dough into a round ball and place it on the pizza tray.
Continue to do this with the rest of the dough.
You should have six round oiled balls of dough.
Cover the tray with a plastic bag and let it rest for an hour.
Dust your work surface (or a silpat or tablecloth youll see why this is helpful in a moment) with flour.
Take one of the dough balls and bring it over to the work surface.
With oiled hands, knead again into an even ball, then flatten it using the palm of your hand.
Pick up the dough by holding it by an edge; gravity will help stretch it as it hangs.
Use the back of your hands to stretch and pull the dough.
Put the dough back down on your work area and begin to gently stretch and pull the dough by using your thumb and index finger.
Stretch and pull the dough until its tissue-thin.
Cut away the thick dough around the edges with scissors.
Dip a spoon or brush into a cup of oil, then drizzle over the pastry in a circular motion.
Evenly sprinkle with a handful of cheese (1/6 of the total amount).
Lift the edges of the tablecloth closest to you and allow the pastry to naturally roll.
Place the roll in the center of a well-oiled pizza tray and form it into a snail shape.
Continue the above steps until you have used up all six dough balls and filling ingredients.
Once you have a full tray of coils, brush the entire pastry with oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Put it in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden brown.
Dont forget to turn down the temperature to 375F when you put it in!

Fill as many ice trays as needed with lemon and lime juice (I ended up using 6 trays).
Cover trays in plastic wrap and poke toothpicks through into each slot, actually the toothpick thing is optional, you could just use them to spice up a drink and make them ice cubes.
I personally find the toothpick thing too messy!
Pop trays into freezer and be sure to check them periodically, but no sticking your fingers through the plastic to get a taste, okay?
ha ha.



In a large frying pan, cook the sugar and butter over medium high heat until its a nice caramel color, and pretty much all the butter is incorporated.

Let harden, then break into pieces and try not to eat the entire batch.



Combine ingredients in bowl.



In a small bowl, combine first 4 ingredients.
Set aside.
Thinly slice steak.
Partially freezing the steak will make it easier to slice thinly.

Allow to cool and crisp, then serve.



Before you get started: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
Coat an oven-safe dish with cooking spraygenerously.
You can use a 13 x 9 for thinner bars or an 8 x 8 for thicker bars, or anything in between.
Making the crunchy crust: Run the pretzels through a food processor but leave some small bits in the mix.
Add 3/4 cup melted butter and the sugar and toss to incorporate.
Press the mixture firmly into the dish and pop it in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes.
Making the marshmallow goodness: After the crust has cooked, cover it with your marshmallows.
I like to use the 2 for the pan, 5 for me ratio.
Pop that back into the oven until the marshmallows are puffy.
Place the pan on a cooling rack and let it cool completely.
COMPLETELY, you hear me?
If you dont, what will happen is (gee, I wonder how I know this) the marshmallows will be displaced by the chocolate mixture that you add in the following step, and you will be left with something very ... very ugly.
Making the gooey part: After the marshmallows have cooled, after they have cooled ... for those of you in the cheap seats, AFTER THEY HAVE COOLED ... take just a few seconds to heat up the caramel in the microwave.
Drizzle then spread the caramel (or butterscotch) over the marshmallow goodness to cover every inch.
An offset spatula works wonders for doing this.
Making the chewy part: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate, corn syrup and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.
Microwave on high for about 30 seconds; stir.
Continue to microwave in 30-second increments until the chocolate is melted.
Stir in the peanut butter, then stir in the Rice Krispies cereal.
Making the masterpiece: Take the chocolate mixture and spread evenly over the marshmallows.
Let the goodness rest for about an hour in the fridge, then cut into squares and store in an airtight container.

In Kitchen Aid style mixer: Mix all ingredients roughly till combined with paddle, let it rest for 10 minutes.
With the paddle (I prefer the hook to prevent the dough from crawling into the guts of the mixer), beat the living hell out of the batter, it will start out like pancake batter but in anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes it will set up and work like a very sticky dough.
if it starts climbing too soon, then switch to the hook.
You'll know it's done when it separates from the side of the bowl and starts to climb up your hook/paddle and just coming off the bottom of the bowl.
I mean this literally about the climbing, i once didn't pay attention and it climbed up my paddle into the greasy inner workings of the mixer.
It was not pretty!
Anyway, it will definitely pass the windowpane test.
Place into a well oiled container and let it triple!
it must triple!
For me this takes about 2.5 hours.
Empty on to a floured counter (scrape if you must, however you gotta get the gloop out), cut into 3 or 4 pieces.
Spray with oil and dust with lots o' flour.
Let them proof for about 45 minutes, which gives you enough time to crank that oven up to 500F.
After 45 minutes or so the loaves should be puffy and wobbly, now it's iron fist, velvet glove time.
Pick up and stretch into your final ciabatta shape (~10" oblong rectangle) and flip them upside down (this redistributes the bubbles, so you get even bubbles throughout), and onto parchment or a heavily floured peel.
Try to do it in one motion and be gentle, it might look like you've ruined them completely, but the oven spring is immense on these things.
Bake at 500F until they are 205F in the center (about 15-20 minutes), rotating 180 degrees half way through.
Some people like to turn the oven down to 450F after 10 minutes, but whatever floats your boat.
I usually bake in 2 batches.

Put the salt, mustard, and vinegar in a small jar (I find an empty Dijon-mustard jar a good size), and shake it to dissolve the salt.
Pour in the olive oil, and shake again thoroughly.
Now taste, and adjust the seasonings to your liking.
Pour about 1 tablespoon over your salad, toss thoroughly, and taste again to determine how much more you want to add.
Try using fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar to vary the flavor, starting with 2 teaspoons and adding more after youve tasted.
The lemon accent is particularly pleasant with young greens, but I prefer a good wine vinegar for everyday use.
White-wine vinegar, champagne vinegar, and occasionally a good balsamic are all welcome for a change.
Add a small, finely chopped shallot (or a portion of a large one) to the vinaigrette, and shake well.
Or, if you want a more assertive dressing, mash a small clove of garlic with a little salt, and shake that up with the dressing.
It is better to add both shallots and garlic shortly before dressing the salad, because they dont keep well in the dressing, even if its refrigerated.
The same goes for herbs; if you want to add a little fresh tarragon or basil or dill, do it just before dressing.
Some cooks prefer to make their dressing in a salad bowl, then plop the greens on top and toss.
But I find that you are less in control, not knowing how much dressing youll need for the amount of greens youll be using.
Better to use the Italian method, which is to salt the salad lightly, then slowly pour on enough olive oil to lightly coat the greens, and finally sprinkle on just enough vinegar to add the zestall the time tossing and tasting.

In 6-8 quart stock pan, measure out 2 cups of apple cider.
This will be approximately how much you will end up with when finished.
Pour in the remaining apple cider.
* If it is kept on an unrefrigerated store shelf, DO NOT use it.
Place on stove top on medium heat and bring to a low boil .
Cook over medium approximately 2-1/2 hours (yes, it does take this long).
Stir occasionally (say every 30-45 minutes).
As the cider begins to get close to desired level of reduction, the bubbles will get smaller & the boil will look somewhat foamy.
Youll need to reduce the heat slightly at this point so that it doesnt boil up or scorch.
Remove from stove and let cool.
Cider should be thick - almost like corn syrup or molasses when done.
Pour into covered container of your choice (pint jar w/lid or condiment bottle with cap).
Store in refrigerator and use as desired.



Stir everything together until smooth.
Smear over cooled down cake or muffins.

OLD SCHOOL METHOD: Mix the yeast and water together in a large mixing bowl with a fork until totally dissolved.
Blend in 1 cup of flour, and all the cornmeal, salt, and oil.
Mix well with a large spoon.
Continue stirring in the rest of the flour in 1/2-cup increments until the dough stops sticking to the sides of the bowl.
Put some flour on your hands and knead the dough until it is no longer sticky, about 5-10 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm, dry, draft-free area for 45-60 minutes to rise until doubled.
Punch it down and knead briefly.
Go to Step #8.
Didn't want to do all that just to have another rise later?
Check out the bread machine instructions!
BREAD MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS: Put all the ingredients into your bread machine according to your manfacturer's directions and do a 1.5-lb or 2-lb dough cycle, kick back and let it do its work.
Press the dough into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pan.
Let it rise for another 20 minutes before pre-baking.
After the rise in the pan is finished, bake at 450F for 10 minutes.
Then add the sauce, cheese, toppings, etc, and whatever else you like and bake at 400F according to how much you put on (ie, meat toppings require longer.)
I like cheese and veggie toppings which only take about 15-20 minutes, then turn on the broiler for 5 minutes to get a nice crispy edge and cheesy crunch.
Don't have a deep-dish pan?
Can probably split this up among casserole dishes and large pie pans.

Cut in 1 cup of chilled, diced butter using a pastry cutter until the butter is in pieces no larger than a pea.
Stir in the buttermilk until a batter has formed.
Spoon the batter evenly over the blackberries.
Brush the top of the batter with additional buttermilk to moisten, then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until the the fruit is tender, and the biscuit top is golden, about 25 minutes.



Put all ingredients in a spice grinder or blender and blend until it is a powder.
Store in a jar with tight fitting lid.



Over a low heat, pour 1/2 cup sugar into a heavy pan.

Stir in the butter, milk, salt and remaining sugar.
Boil the mixture until it reaches soft ball stage, approximately 236 degrees F (115 degrees C).
Cool the mixture to room temperature.
When the mixture has cooled, stir in the vanilla extract.
With an electric mixer, beat the mixture until it is thick and creamy.
Spread on cake.



Remember 2 tablespoons plain flour to 1 tablespoon of plain yoghurt, makes 2-3 flatbreads (great for a hungry adult 7-8 inches round ish) Add pinck of salt, (if you like it leave out if you don't) add splash of tepid water, this aids rolling out the flatbread dough I find.
So mix the flour and yoghurt & water in bowl and your done !
Fast mix huh ?.
Ok divide dough into 2 or 3 bits and roll out onto flour surfice/board into thin patties.
I free form the dough and happily roll away making a natural "see where it takes me" shape dough.
I like that, although for more formal flatbread dining occassions I have be known to use a dinner/side plate as a template and using a rounded blunt knife carved the perfect flatbread round.
A match for any a shop aquired imitation !
Now heat a heavy skillet and cook on high heat for a minute or 2 each side.
This bread will bubble up, great !
Now how quick and easy was this to make ?.
Have flatbreads with curry, chilli con carne, spag Bol , make food wraps with them , what about adding tomato puree ,cheese and pepperoni and then grill them ?
Like little flatbread pizza's , the list of uses goes on and on !
Tip, if your mix seam a little sticky, worry not.
Add flour.
This recipe is very forgiving, pat off excess before putting onto hot griddle.
Cook all fltbreads, sometimes just before serving (And these can be made a few hours in advance and left covered) add some garlic butter and fresh corriander and grill for 30 seconds for wonderful garlic flatbreads !
Enjoy & listen to your guests go hmmm, hmmm hmmmmm !
!
If you don't like yor guests do not give them the recipe !

Soak beans in a pan of water overnight then drain before cooking.
Boil the soaked beans until the skins crack when you blow on them.
(With a spoon, lift some out of the boiling water and blow on them.
If the skins crackle, they are done.)
This step is important because the beans don't soften up any more while baking, and you don't want them to be too hard.
Drain the beans and place them in your bean pot (any ceramic piece will do as long as it has a lid).
Add uncooked bacon and chopped onion.
In a sauce pan, bring the rest of the ingredients to a boil.
Once everything is melted and combined, pour the mixture over the beans in the pot.
Make sure the liquid covers the beans.
If not, then add more water.
Bake in covered pot at 250 degrees for about 4 hours.
Check periodically to make sure the liquid level does not get too low.
They will thicken as they bake, but you should have a little juice so they are not too dry.
The beans will be dark brown, and thick when they are done.



Mix dry ingredients together.
Add liquid ingredients and mix on medium speed in Kitchen Aid Mixer until a ball forms.
Let dough rise until double in size -- about one hour.
Form into pretzel shapes, sticks or rolls.

Refrigerate pretzels for about 10 minutes, let rolls or sticks rise for 10-15 minutes.
Dip in Lye bath for 10 seconds or boiling baking soda mixture for 30 seconds.
Place on parchment lined cookie sheets.
Slit with a sharp knife or razor blade.

Drain cranberries in a colander over a bowl, reserving steeping liquid, if desired.
Place superfine sugar in a shallow dish.
Add the cranberries, rolling to coat with sugar.
Spread sugared cranberries in a single layer on a baking sheet; let stand at room temperature 1 hour or until dry.
Note: The steeping liquid clings to the berries and helps the sugar adhere.
Store in an airtight container in a cool place for up to a week.



Grease 900 g loaf pan.

Put bread flour into a large mixing bowl.
Add sugar, salt and yeast to the flour.
Stir to combine evenly.
Combine melted butter and warm water.
Pour water mixture into flour mixture and stir by hand with a large spoon.
At this point the dough will look more like pancake batter than pizza dough, but continue to stir once combined for a minute or two to really develop those glutens!
Stir in (by hand) 2-3 more cups of the AP flour.
This should bring the dough to a point where it is kneadable.
Use remaining flour to dust a clean, smooth work surface.
Knead the dough to work in as much flour until the dough is no longer tacky.
The outside "skin" will be smooth.
Divide the dough into the desired number of pizzas.
This Recipe makes two large pizzas or four small pizzas.
Roll each part of divided dough into balls, coat with olive oil and place each in a seperate large bowl.
Turn oven on to 350F, but only allow to preheat for one minute then turn the oven off.
The idea is to just warm the oven; Not to get it hot.
Cover each bowl with a damp towel.
Place in the warm oven to rise 2-3 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.
Flour pizza pans and turn out risen dough on each pan.
Be gentle with the dough while spreading it to the edges in the pan keeping it as even as possible.
Use a fork to dock the entire dough (except the edges where the crust will be).
Preheat oven to 450F.
Bake each dough/crust for 10 minutes without toppings or sauce (yes, i know this is sacreligious to many pizza-philes, but it works for this recipe).
Remove crust from oven, add desired sauce and toppings, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes.
De-pan the pizzas.
Allow pizzas to sit for 5 minutes before slicing (this is the hardest step :) It's a good time to go pour yourself a cold beer).



Preheat oven to 375 degrees G. Grease a 6x10x2 inch pan or possibly baking dish.

If time allows, soak the beans for several hours or overnight, then drain.
(If not, proceed, but expect cooking time to be somewhat longer.)
Place in a pot, add water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Partially cover, adjust the heat so the mixture simmers steadily, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are nearly tender and most of the water has evaporated, at least an hour and probably more.
(Add water as necessary to keep the beans covered, but bear in mind that eventually you will want no water at all, so dont drown them.)
Add the sugar, mirin, and soy sauce and raise the heat a bit.
Continue to cook, stirring frequently now, until the beans are glazed and still firm, not quite as tender as youre used to; leave them quite moist (the soy sauce will burn if the mixture dries out).
Stir in the sesame oil.
You can serve the beans immediately, at room temperature, or chilled.
Just before serving, toast the sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan frequently until the seeds color slightly.
Sprinkle the beans with the seeds and serve.

Put the pastry bag/cookie press into the fridge or freezer while each tray is cooking.
Otherwise, the butter and cheese gets too soft, and you get cheese "crackers" instead of straws!
Cool each tray for 5 minutes, (I prepare the next tray while they are cooling) then move the cooled straws to a wire rack.
Keeps well in air-tight containers.

Combine the sugar and buttermilk in a non-aluminum saucepan and simmer for about 45 minutes over low heat, stirring frequently so that it does not turn into a transparent cheese.
When done, it should sheet from the spoon like jelly and be the color of very light clover honey.
It should taste like honey with a slight buttermilk aftertaste.
If the buttermilk flavor is too strong, add the baking soda, which sweetens it.
However, the baking soda will make it frothy for a few minutes and, if the sugar has impurities, they will come to the surface.

Place bread machine pan on electronic scales and weigh in / add the ingredients.
(280ml water weighs 280g).
Replace pan in bread machine and start on suitable cycle - I favour the wholemeal cycle with a dark crust as it has the longest rise time but still has a beep for adding ingredients plus I like my bread to be crusty.
Machines vary but the raisin bread setting should also be fine.
Whilst the machine is kneading, chop and prepare the red pepper & red onion into a small bowl and season to taste with a little fresh ground black pepper, a very generous dash of dried (or fresh) garlic (possibly some basil/oregano if you fancy it herby, and paprika if you *really* love it spicy!
).
Add the pepper & onion a bit at a time during the last five minutes of the final knead (my machine does its beep five minutes before the end of the final (second) knead) as there is a lot of liquid in these fresh ingredients and if you add them all at once it would make the dough rather too wet.
Basically add about half of them at the beep and the other half a few minutes later.
Enjoy!
(Time listed includes total kneading, rising & baking time).

If the sauce becomes too thick while cooking, just add a few more tablespoons of water.



In a bowl whisk together sugar, oil, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and salt.
Place in refrigerator for several hours.
This helps the sugar dissolve and the flavors to blend.
For serving combine the spinach, strawberries, and dressing in a large bowl.
Toss to coat well.
I like to start with part of the dressing and toss and add more as needed.
You can also serve the spinach, strawberries, and dressing separate and let everyone serve their own amounts of each.

Chill everything, except the breadcrumbs and honey...this includes the condensed milk, cream, but also the bowl you will whisk the cream in, the tub you will freeze the ice cream in, even the whisk, if you want!
Heat oven to 190 C.
Mix the breadcrumbs in a bowl with the 3 tbsp honey, getting it all well mixed.
Don't worry if they clump a little as you can separate them after cooking.
I used a butter knife to mix, as this prevents large scale clumping.
Spread the breadcrumbs out evenly on a baking tray.
Put the breadcrumbs in the oven and get them browned and crispy.
Turn them around every few minutes.
This could take 10-20 minutes, the important thing is to keep checking and moving them.
Cool the breadcrumbs.
Crumble any clumpy bits.
Whisk the cream until it's very thick.
Fold in the condensed milk, honey and most of the breadcrumbs (reserve some for sprinkling) using a metal spoon.
Pour the mixture into the tub you are using, place a layer of plastic wrap over the top, pressed gently over the surface of the ice cream.
Put the lid on.
Freeze for at least four hours, but it's fine to make it in the morning to eat in the evening.
This ice cream is best eaten on the day or within two days of being made, to enjoy the texture.
Take the ice cream out of the freezer 10 minutes before serving to thaw slightly.
Serve with extra drizzles of honey and a sprinkle of crunchy breadcrumbs.

Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl.
Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.
Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first.
The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together.
Fry until golden brown and crispy.
Remove and drain on paper towels.



Measure your flour, salt, garlic powder, parsley, and baking powder into a big bowl.
Stir the dry ingredients together so that they are evenly distributed throughout the flour.
Now, pour in the milk.
Stir with a big spoon until you have a ball of dough that leaves the sides of the bowl.
You may have to dust the ball of dough with a little flour if it seems sticky to you.
Gently knead the ball of dough right there in the bowl 5 or 6 times.
Now place your dough on the counter.
You may use a piece of waxed paper under the dough if you like.
Using a rolling pin roll out the dough to a rectangular shape.
If the edges become uneven, use your hands to reshape into a rectangle.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
You are aiming for a rectangle that will fi into a 9- by 13-inch pan.
When you get the dough the right size, set it aside.
Meanwhile, place the margarine in the 9- by 13-inch pan and place the pan in a 425F oven to melt the margarine.
When the margarine is melted, carefully remove the pan from the oven, so as not to burn yourself.
Sprinkle the second teaspoon of garlic powder and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the pan.
You do not have to use the extra salt.
Now, very carefully, lay your rectangle of dough into the pan, over top of the margarine.
Next cut the rectangle into narrow strips.
One method of doing this is to cut the dough in half, then cut each half again, quartering the dough, and then cut each quarter into narrow strips.
The margarine will creep up between the strips.
This is normal.
It is what gives these bread sticks their texture.
After cutting your strips, place the pan in the oven, still at 425F, and bake them for 20 minutes.
They will be browned and crispy when they are done.
The parsley is simply for decoration.
It makes the bread sticks look more gourmet, but it adds little to the flavor or the texture.
Leave it out if you don't have any, or are running low.
If desired, you may sprinkle the bread sticks with a little bit of parmesan cheese before or after baking.
This tastes good, but once again, is optional.



Heat the oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Add the onions, celery and carrots and saute, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes.
Add the green beans, tomatoes, salt and pepper.
Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, about 55-65 minutes.

All you who do not brine yer chickens, listen up.
I know this whole thing went down a while ago, but....
I started brining the chicken I've been doing since the consensus on the porch was to do it.
Now finally today I did six chickens at the same time and decided to try to see what difference it really makes.
Well, it's a big deal!
!
I did two with a salt, pepper and paprika rub and the other four were brined overnight with 3/4 c. salt, 1/2 c. sugar, 1/4 c. molasses and 1 tsp each of garlic and onion pwdr per gallon of water.
All six were smoked at about 250F for around 2 1/2 hrs.
I used almond wood and moped with 1/2 corn oil and 1/2 coke along with salt and pepper and rosemary.
The result: no comparison.
While the non-brined was ok, the brined birds had a lot more smoke flavor and were also much more moist.
The skin on the brined chickens did not crisp while the non-brined skins did.
This is a minor price to pay.
Overall, DO IT.
Any one who doesn't brine their birds is missing out big time.
Not which I wasn't a believer before, now I will definitely not even consider doing it otherwise.

Sprinkle entire roast evenly with salt and wrap with Saran Wrap.
Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 225F and place rack in center of oven.
Remove roast from fridge and pat dry with paper towels.
Using 2 teaspoons oil, coat roast evenly.
Coat entire roast with black pepper.
Using remaining oil in large, heavy skillet, brown meat on all sides.
If you eliminate this step, you will sacrifice flavor and probably wind up with an unappetizing gray roast.
Place the roast in a rack set over a roasting pan or shallow sheet pan and place in oven.
Here's the trick to the whole process.
Roast the meat until the center of the roast reaches 115F for medium rare or 125F for medium.
Don't exceed 125F for best results.
This took about 1 hour for a 2-1/2 lb roast and about 1 hr and 45 minutes for a 4 pound roast.
Don't rely entirely on times to judge doneness.
Temperature is very important here.
Once temperature is reached, turn off the oven, leaving roast undisturbed, until internal temperature reaches 130F for medium-rare and 140F for medium.
Depending on roast size, this could be anywhere from 15 minutes to and hour longer.
If the roast doesn't reach the desired temperature in a reasonable time, reheat the oven to 225F for a few minutes, turn oven off again and finish the process.
Remove roast from oven; let rest for the usual 15 minutes and slice thinly to serve.
Notes: If your roast size varies from the 4 pounds mentioned, adjust the salt and pepper accordingly.
Also, don't open the oven door any more than absolutely necessary.
A thermometer with remote sensor, that can remain in the center of the roast while it is in the oven, is a great help.
Remember, it's temperature, not time that makes this work.
Seasonings are up to you but don't neglect the initial salt as it contributes to the tenderizing process.
Because it is enzymes in the meat that help tenderize the tissues up to about 122F, keeping the temperature below this point for as long a possible improves tenderness.

Rinse the garbanzo beans, drain and cover with water to cover by 3 inches.
Soak beans for 4 to 6 hours.
Drain in a colander and rinse thoroughly.
Note: The key to this hummus recipe is to just soak the beans for the 4 to 6 hours the recipe calls for.
If you soak them overnight they will absorb too much liquid and you will have very mushy beans and lots of water.
If you don't have time to do a 4 to 6 hour soak, you can do a quick soak by bringing the beans and soaking water to a boil and boiling for 1 minute.
Remove the beans and water from the heat and let stand for 30 minutes before draining and continuing with the recipe.

In a large mixing bowl, combine shortening with flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon; cut together until well-mixed and crumbly.
Start adding the chilled water one tablespoon at a time to the dough.
After 2 or 3 spoonfuls, begin kneading the dough by hand, using additional water only sparingly.
You shouldnt need more than 5 tablespoons at the absolute most.
Once you can get the dough into one big lump that wont easily fall apart on you, divide it into two portions and lay one on a floured surface.
(Keep the other half covered with damp paper towel until needed.)
Flour hands and rolling pin before flattening dough to about 3/16 thick.
*If youre afraid of transferring the dough, you can use this easy trick: Flour a piece of waxed paper, secure the edges to your countertop here-and-there using tape, and roll out the dough on the floured paper.
Grease and flour a lightweight pie pan and invert it over the crust.
Flip the pan over with the crust on top, and then peel back the waxed paper thats now on top.
Perfectly centered, and no one will ever have to know you cheated.
Note: Never roll a pie crust from one end to the other; always begin in the center of the ball and make short, brisk movements outward, then lift pin to return it to the center starting point for the next stroke.
Its helpful to continually use your fingertips to seal up cracks on the outside of the perimeter of the dough as you roll it out uniformly.
Repeat method with the second lump of dough.
Fill crusts and bake as needed according to pie recipe, or using the following rule: 20 minutes at 350 degrees F for a prebake (meaning pie will then be filled and baked further) OR 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees F for a completely baked crust that wont be returning to the oven.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.
Mix the 2 flours and stir them in to make a soft dough.
Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4 minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook.
Oil a clean bowl and set the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk.
(In the traditional warm place, this will take about 2 hours.
However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the dough has enough time to rise, including overnight in the refrigerator.)
If the dough is ready sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use.
Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet.
When the dough has completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured work surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches wide, 10 inches long, and 1/4 inch thick.
It will still be very soft, but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it.
Roll the dough tight, jelly-roll fashion, into a cylindrical shape.
Flatten this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again.
(This activates the web of gluten that will keep the loaf from flattening out in the oven.)
FOR A ROUND LOAF, tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the center, pinching to seal them.
Roll the dough around the work surface under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in diameter.
FOR AN OBLONG LOAF, roll the dough under your hands into a fat cigar shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length.
Set the loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely around it.
Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.
Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F (200C).
Have a water-filled sprayer handy.
Slide your hand under the towel, pick up the loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles.
Spray water into the oven before closing the door, and spray twice more at 2-minute intervals.
Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown.
The bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its bottom.

Wash the jar you'll be using to make the umeshu, and sterilize it in boiling water (dry it well afterwards) or sterilize with alcohol.
Choose green ume plums, and throw out any that are blemished.
Wash them well (gently so that you don't damage) and drain into a colander.
Take the stem ends off carefully.
After removing the stem ends, wipe each ume fruit gently with paper towels.
Make several holes in the surface of the ume plums with a bamboo skewer so that the skins won't get wrinkled.
Put the ume plums, crystal rock sugar, distilled alcohol in the jar in that order.
Put the lid on and you're done Shake it occasionally and wait for at least 3 months.
I used this food grade alcohol spray this time.
From left to right: 2 year old umeshu; 1 year old umeshu; and this year's batch The matured umeshu has turned an amber color.

Combine ingredients in a bowl or your bread machine and mix.
If using a bread machine, use the Dough setting and let it run its course.
If mixing by hand, knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic, allow to rise in a greased bowl until doubled in size (roughly 1 hour).
After removing the dough from the bread machine, or letting it rise by hand, punch it down and knead it again for a few minutes to smooth it back out.
Form the dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl.
Cover with greased plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least 8 hours (overnight is better).
After the second rise, preheat the oven to 450 degrees and set a large pot of water with 3 tbsp of sugar to boil.
Spread a thin layer of cornmeal in a baking sheet and have it standing by.
Also, set up a draining rig with a wire rack in another baking sheet (or at least over some towels or something).
Once the water boils, take the dough from the fridge and cut it into 6 equal-sized pieces.
Form each piece into a ball, punch a hole through the middle and shape it into a smooth ring.
Drop the bagels into the boiling water a few at a time so as not to crowd (I do 4 or so at once).
Let them boil for 2 minutes.
A few seconds into the boil give the bagels a little nudge with a slotted spoon to make sure they aren't sticking to the bottom of the pot.
You'll know they're ready to come out of the water when they bob to the surface and lie flat on the water (not hanging down at an angle).
Transfer the bagels to your draining rig and finish boiling the rest of your bagels.
Once they're done, arrange them on the cornmeal covered baking sheet and brush each with an egg wash (just a beaten egg).
When putting the bagels in the oven, throw 3 ice cubes in the bottom so that they'll create steam as they melt.
Bake at 450 for 12-15 minutes until golden brown and the bagels sound hollow when tapped.



To steam green beans: In a large non-stick skillet, bring 1/2 inch salted water to a boil.

Using a colander, strain water off green beans.
Set aside.
Drain any remaining water from skillet and place over medium heat.
Add butter to pan, melt until frothy and watch the pan carefully until the butter begins to brown.
Remove from heat and stir in seasonings.
Return pan to heat, return green beans to pan, toss in butter mixture and serve immediately.



Heat the oven to 200 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle.
Sprinkle the cheese on a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer.
Bake until the cheese melts and the oil separates out of it, about 1 hour.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and blot off any oil from the surface of the cheese with paper towels.
Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake until the cheese is completely dry and brittle, about 2 hours more.
Meanwhile, fold 4 paper towels in half lengthwise and place them on a work surface.
When the cheese is ready, immediately transfer it to the paper towels using a flat metal spatula.
Blot any remaining oil from the surface with additional paper towels.
Break the cheese into small pieces.
Working in batches, grind the cheese pieces in a coffee or spice grinder until a fine powder forms.
Transfer the powder to a medium bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and whisk to combine; set aside.
Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and keep the rack in the middle.
Place the seeds and oil in a large bowl and stir until the seeds are evenly coated.
Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and spread the seeds in an even layer.
(Reserve the bowlyou dont need to wash it.)
Roast, stirring halfway through, until the seeds are fragrant and starting to brown, about 10 minutes total.
Immediately transfer the seeds to the reserved bowl.
(Reserve the baking sheetno need to wash.) Add the nacho cheese powder and stir to evenly coat the seeds.
Return the coated seeds to the reserved baking sheet and spread them in an even layer.
Let them cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.



Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the two long sides.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the oats, sunflower seeds, almonds, cranberries, flour, and salt.
Add the oat mixture to the butter mixture and fold until just combined.
Gently press the mixture into the prepared pan and bake until light golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
Using the overhangs, transfer the bar to a cutting board and cut into 24 pieces.



In a small bowl, combine yogurt, ketchup, Worcestershire, mustard, brown sugar, Tabasco, onion powder and garlic powder.
Whisk until smooth.
Brush on chicken or ribs during the last 20 minutes of cooking, on steaks or port chops for last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking.



Blend the blueberries and sugar in a food processor until smooth; strain through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing with a wooden spoon to separate the blueberry puree from any chunks of skin or seeds.
Stir the strained blueberry puree, water, and lemon juice together in a shallow glass baking dish or tray.
Place the dish in the freezer; scrape and stir the blueberry mixture with a fork once an hour until evenly frozen and icy, about 4 hours.
Scrape to fluff and lighten the ice crystals; spoon into chilled glasses to serve.



Squeeze lemon or limes over a sieve into a medium mixing bowl.
Whisk in the other ingredients (not the olive oil) until very smooth, and the sugar has just about dissolved.
Whisk in the olive oil in a thin stream, almost as for mayonnaise.
The dressing will thicken slightly -- it won't become thick, and it's not supposed to.
Taste the dressing: you might want to add more lemon juice.
Mine needed a squeeze more than stated above.
Decant into a salad dressing container or bottle.
Great over any type of salad.

This recipie is for a small batch of jam.
It should make 2-3 250ml (8oz) jars, but its easy to double or triple.
1.5 lbs of fruit = 1/4 cup of sugar.
Wash and halve or quarter your apricots, and stick them in a covered container with the sugar and lemon juice and let macerate overnight in the fridge.
(You can skip this step, but it adds a richer deeper flavour.)
Pour the macerated fruit and the juices that its soaking in into a Dutch oven or a thick-bottomed pot, and bring to a simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, skimming the top if needed.
Depending on how chunky you want your jam, after about 15-20 minutes cooking time, the fruit should be starting to fall apart.
You can then mash it with a potato masher to make it a less chunky jam.
At this stage you might want to test its tartness; some people dont like a tart jam, and may want to add another 1/4 cup of sugar.
And then continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes until it reaches jam-like consistency, then spoon onto a cold plate to check if its finished.
Spoon the jam into hot sterilized jars, sealing immediately.
This is a nice tart jam, and goes well with toast, or in baked goods, or spooned over vanilla ice cream or yoghurt.

Combine the following ingredients to make a marinade:
Cut 2-3 lbs of wings into 3 pcs.
Throw away the wingtips and marinate the remaining pcs for at least 30 min.
Agitate the pcs occasionally while they are marinating.
Cover a cookie pan with foil and, using tongs, place the marinated wing pcs on it.
I suggest using a cookie PAN, as opposed to a sheet, because the sides will insure which none of the marinade mix drips off the edge and screws up your oven.
There should be a slight seperation between each individual piece so they do not stick together.
Cook for one hour at 350 F, turning the wing pcs every 10 min.
If you want them to come out nice and even, you need to turn them individually with a pair of tongs.
If you do not turn them, they'll stick and burn on one side.
After they are done, let stand for at least 20 min.
Serve warm or possibly at room temperature.

Chill balls in fridge.



Combine the yeast with the remainder of the ingredients.
Mix and knead everything togetherby hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycletill you've made a soft, smooth dough.
If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom.
Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.
Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it's very puffy.
This will take about an hour using instant yeast.
Shape it into a rough circle.
In either case, don't pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape.
Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.
Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice.
Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s).
The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch.
Place the dough in the prepared pan(s).
Press it over the bottom of the pan, stretching it towards the edges.
You'll probably get about two-thirds of the way there before the dough starts shrinking back; walk away for 15 minutes.
Cover the dough while you're away, so it doesn't dry out.
Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes.
Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450F.
Bake the pizza on the lower oven rack till it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top.
This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza.
To serve pizza immediately: Remove it from the oven, and arrange your toppings of choice on top.
Return to the oven, and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted.
Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough.
To serve pizza up to 2 days later: Remove the untopped, partially baked crust from the oven, cool completely on a rack, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature.
When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above.
Your goal is a pizza whose crust is browned, and whose toppings are hot/melted.

Add sugar or honey to boiling water to dissolve.
Allow to cool to 105* F.
Add yeast and yeast energizer, stir, then cover with cloth.
While allowing the yeast time to wakeup (1 hour) sterilize the stopper and airlock.
Open the quart bottle of juice or nectar and pour out 1 and 1/4 cup of it (this doesn't need to be saved.
).
Add the mixture to the juice/nectar, put the lid on and invert the bottle a couple of times to mix up the two.
Insert your sterilized bottle stop and then insert your airlock into that.
Add water to the airlock, enough to meet the watermark in both chambers.Place it in a warm area and let it sit until the airlock bubbles only every 3 minutes or so.
(one to two weeks).
Once the fermentation has slowed down considerably, pour (or 'rack' with a siphoning tube) to a bottle of the same size.
This will separate your wine from the 'lees' (the dead yeast that accumulate in the bottom of the bottle).
Remove 1 cup of the wine and taste test or dispose of.
It's not needed at this point.
If the fermentation went well it won't be sweet at all at this point.
Add another cup of warm sugarwater (1/2 water & 1/2 sugar dissolved) to the bottle and reinsert the stopper and airlock (sterilized again if necessary).
Let ferment until the airlock is bubbling once every five minutes.
'Rack' again and at this point you can either drink the wine or let it age for another two months before enjoying.

Note: This recipe requires use of a pressure cooker.
1.
In a large zipper bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper.
Place the beef cubes into the bag, seal the bag and shake to completely coat, making sure to separate the cubes of beef from each other.
2.
In a large pressure cooker pot, place a thin layer of vegetable oil (I started with 2 tablespoons) and heat over medium heat until hot.
3.
Using tongs, remove the beef from the flour bag and shake off the excess coating.
Place beef in the hot oil and brown for approximately 2 minutes per side.
Note: Do not overcrowd the pan.
They must brown in a single layer.
I had to cook mine in 4 batches, removing the cooked beef to a plate until ready to move to the next step!
4.
Add additional oil, if needed, to cook all of the meat.
The beef will not be cooked throughout at this point!
This step is only to help set the crust as well as create some flavor deposits on the pan to make the gravy.
5.
Once its all been cooked, return all the meat to the pan and fill with enough water to just come to the top or barely cover the beef.
The more water you add, the thinner the gravy will be in the end.
I used 1 1/2 cups.
6.
Secure the lid to the pressure cooker and set it to the low pressure setting.
7.
From the time of pressurization (when the jiggling or steam release begins) cook the meat for 35 minutes.
After the 35 minutes of pressure cooking, remove from heat and allow to depressurize naturally.
The beef will continue to cook during this time.
8.
Once the pressure has been released, remove the lid and return the pot to the burner.
Allow to simmer on low heat for 5 minutes.
Taste the gravy at this time.
If you need to add additional salt and pepper, do so now and allow to simmer for at least 2 minutes after the additional seasoning is added.
9.
To serve, create a bed of mashed potatoes and spoon the beef and gravy over the top.



Fold in the order recommended by your breadmaker.
This uses the powdered-lowfat milk white/wheat setting on the Black & Decker.

Note: make the caramel sauce first so it has time to cool.
For the caramel sauce: Place a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and combine sugar and warm water.
Stir until the sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes.
Bring the syrup to a boil and do not stir; let it start to caramelize.
You can gently swirl the pan to help it start to brown.
Watch, not stirring, until it turns an amber colour.
Now remove from the heat and add cold butter.
Stir in the heavy cream.
You may return the pan to low heat if the mixture is not smoothening out right away.
Add the vanilla and the salt.
Stir unti smooth.
Let the caramel cool for about 15 minutes.
For the turtle bark: Melt your chocolate in a double boiler.
(All you do is bring water in a pot to a boil then turn it down to simmer, or slightly above simmer.
Then place your other pot on top and pop the chocolate in that.
I do not have a double boiler so I place a heat proof glass bowl on top of the pot.
It works beautifully.)
Let the chocolate melt.
Stir it now and then.
Once its melted, pour it into a parchment-lined pan (8 x 8 is best; I did it on a cookie sheet which made it too thin).
Toss the pecans over top.
Then toss the Skor bits over top.
Pop the bark in the fridge to set.
Once your caramel is cooled (if its not, itll melt your chocolatethis is super important), pour it over your bark.
Pop it back in the fridge for a bit to set up.
Remove and break apart or cut.
I like mine roughly chopped or broken.
Im not a big fan of clean edges on bark.



Preheat the oven to 350F.
Brush a 12-cup medium muffin tin with oil.
Combine the flour, mayonnaise, milk, and sugar in a bowl.
Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, spoon dough into each muffin cup, filling about half full.
Alternatively, drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a greased baking sheet.
Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly, then invert the biscuits onto the rack to cool until warm.
Serve warm.
Wheat flour contains two proteins, glutenin and gliadin.
When you combine flour with water, the proteins create a strong and elastic sheet called gluten.
Flours vary in their protein levels, which affects the texture of baked goods.
Gluten gives structure to yeast breads, but is not recommended for tender cakes, biscuits, and quick breads.
Southern all-purpose flour is milled from soft red winter wheat that has less gluten-forming protein.
It is typically bleached, which makes it whiter, but this does not affect the protein.
My family has always used White Lily flour, a staple across the South; another dependable Southern brand is Martha White.
Most national brands of all-purpose flour are a combination of soft winter wheat and higher-protein hard summer wheat.
White Lily contains approximately nine grams of protein per cup of flour, whereas national brands can contain eleven or twelve grams of protein per cup of flour.
If you live outside the South, White Lily is available online or in some specialty shops in other parts of the country.
For results similar to those of Southern flour, substitute one part all-purpose flour and one part cake flour for the amount of Southern flour in a recipe.
Finally, high-protein flour absorbs more liquid than does low-protein flour; if you attempt to make biscuits with a high-protein flour, you will need to add more liquid.
Self-rising flour is all-purpose flour that is low in protein and contains a leavening agent and salt.
It is widely available in the South, but less so in other regions of the country.
If you have a recipe that calls for self-rising flour, use the following formula to convert all-purpose into self-rising: to 1 cup of Southern all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt.

Place in a lightly greased bowl, covered and allow to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until its expanded a bit.
It won't have doubled in size, but should feel puffy when you squeeze it.
Lightly grease a 9x5 loaf pan.
Gently shape the dough into a smooth log, there's no need to punch it down, just stretch and round it to fit in the pan.
Place it in the pan, smooth side up, cover the pan and allow it to rise for about 30-45 minutes, till it crowns over the rim by an inch or so.
Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375F.

After oat mixture is cooled, gently fold in peanut butter chips.
Spread into prepared pan and lightly press down with spatula.
Let cool completely, then cut into bars.
Store, covered, in the refrigerator or on counter.
Notes: Be sure to let oat mixture cool after everything is combined (but before peanut butter chips are added), so that the heat from the brown sugar mixture does not melt peanut butter chips.

Make the sponge.
In a mixer bowl or other large bowl, combine the flour, water, honey, and instant yeast.
Whisk until very smooth, to incorporate air, about 2 minutes.
The sponge will be the consistency of a thick batter, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.
Make the flour mixture and add to the sponge.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast.
Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature.
(During this time, the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in places: this is fine).
Mix the dough.
HAND METHOD.
Add the salt and butter to the bowl and, with a wooden spoon or with your hand, stir until all the flour is moistened.
Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to keep the dough from sticking.
Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it.
At this point, it will be very sticky.
Cover it with an inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.
(This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with).
Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic.
It should still be tacky enough to cling slightly to your fingers a little.
If the dough is still very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra.
Shape the dough and let it rise.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half.
Shape each piece into a loaf; the exact size is not important at this point.
(A long side of the dough should be facing toward you).
Dimple the dough with your fingers to deflate any large bubbles.
Fold over the right side of the dough to a little past the center.
Fold over hte left side of the dough to overlap it slightly.
Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to seal the dough.
(If you have a lot of experiance shaping, you may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees- a quarter turn).
Starting at the top end of the dough, roll it over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the outer skin.
As you roll and press, the dough will become wider.
If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together on top of the dough and, rolling back and fourth, gradually work your way towards the ends, gently stretching the dough.
For the most even shape, it is important to keep a tight skin on the surface of the dough and not to tear it.
If you want the edges of the loaf to be smooth, tuck the sides under.
Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans; the dough will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans.
Cover them with a large container, or cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until the center is about 1 inch above the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
When the dough is pressed with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill inches.
Preheat the oven.
Preheat the oven to 350F 45 minutes before baking.
Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or a baking sheet on it, and a cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the floor of the oven, before preheating.
Bake the bread.
Quickly but gently set the pans on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet.
Toss 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately shut the door.
Bake for 50 minutes or until medium golden brown and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210F).
Halfway through baking, turn the pans around for even baking.
Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.



Fill a shaker with ice cubes.
Add the vodka, coffee liqueur and melted vanilla ice cream.
Shake and strain into a chilled rocks glass filled with ice cubes.

You may need to toss with additional flour to prevent sticking to your cutting board or rolling pin.
Add raw strips or squares of dough to your chicken and dumpling broth (on a low simmer) for about 10 minutes.
Stir once or twice gently every five minutes.
No more or they might break apart or become gummy and sticky.

Warm a stand mixer bowl for 5 minutes with hot water.
Then add 2 cups warm water and yeast.
Stir gently.
Let the yeast activate.

Once active, add the olive oil, honey, salt and oatmeal.
Then add 4 cups of whole wheat flour.
Put the dough hook on the mixer and mix.
Once all the liquid is incorporated, keep adding flour to the dough until it comes away from the sides of the bowl, and forms a ball.
(You can also knead this by hand.
But I am lazy.
The dough hook works great!)
Take the dough and put it in a greased large bowl.
Cover with a cloth towel and put in a warm dry place to rise.
I put mine in the oven with the oven light on.
Let rise until dough is doubled in size.
(I would give it about 1 hour).
After dough has done the 1st rise, punch the dough down, take it out of the bowl, and cut in half.
Roll each half and roll each half into a loaf.
Put in a greased loaf pan.
Put both loaves in the same oven with the light on and once again, let it rise until doubled (about 40 minutes or less).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (take the loaves out before) and bake for about 40 minutes until crust is golden brown.

To make the outer dough, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times to combine.
Sprinkle in the pieces of lard and process for 10 seconds to blend well, or until the mixture looks like coarse meal.
(Alternatively, put the ingredients in a bowl and use a pastry blender or your fingers in a quick rubbing motion to combine the flour and shortening.)
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, make a well in the center, and work in the water 1 tablespoon at a time.
Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir, fold, and push the ingredients into a ragged mass.
Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently knead for about 2 minutes to create a very soft , smooth, and slightly elastic dough.
Press your finger into the dough; it should slowly bounce back, leaving a faint indentation.
Cover with plastic wrap or an inverted bowl and set aside at room temperature to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the inner dough, put the flour in the food processor and sprinkle in the lard pieces.
Process for 10 seconds to blend and generate a mealy, lumpy, very soft mixture.
Transfer to a bowl (the same one as before is fine) and use the spatula to mix and combine well.
(Alternatively, put the ingredients in the bowl and use the spatula or back of the wooden spoon to mash the ingredients together until no flour is visible.)
It will resemble soft cookie dough.
Gather and pat the dough into a rough ball.
Push it from the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface.
Gently pat and roll the dough into a smooth ball and set aside.
Wrap in plastic wrap if the outer dough needs to rest longer.
To encase the inner dough in the outer dough, roll the outer dough into a 6- to 7-inch-diameter circle.
(Try your best to work on a minimally floured surface at all times, to prevent the dough from absorbing too much flour and toughening.)
Center the ball of inner dough on top and then gently pull up and press the outer dough, pinching the ends together to completely encase the inner dough.
Hold the dough in both hands to make this easier.
Use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough into an oblong, about 8 inches wide and 12 inches long.
Start each pass from the center and move toward one of the edges before rolling back again.
Try to square off the sides and lift up the dough occasionally to prevent sticking.
If a bit of the inner dough leaks out, pat some flour on it to seal.
Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, with one end toward the middle and the other end on top to cover, resulting in a rectangle about 8 inches wide and 4 inches long.
Turn the dough 90 degrees so that one of the unfolded sides points at you.
Roll the dough out again to an 8 by 12-inch rectangle, and fold again into a letter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or overnight, before using.
See the following recipes for details on how to manipulate the dough into patterned layers.

Wash the tomatoes and bring a large pot of water to a boil.
When the water is boiling, submerge the tomatoes for a few seconds to scald them and remove to a bowl of cold water to stop the tomaotes from cooking.
Peel them, cut in half and remove seeds.
Weigh the tomatoes.
For every 3kg of tomato flesh, you'll need 1.5kg sugar and 500ml water.
Put the water and sugar in a pan on the stove top.
Stir over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved in the water, making a syrup.
Bring the syrup to a boil, add tomatoes, and cook for 15-20 minutes, lowering the heat to a simmer.
Be sure to watch the pot so that it doesn't boil over-it gets foamy!
The foam can be skimmed off the top.
After 20 minutes, turn the stove off and let the mixture sit for a few hours.
After a few hours, re-heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, taking care that it doesn't stick or burn.
Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let cook for 1-2 hours, stirring periodically.
The timing is a bit vague but you want to get to the syrup to a jelly set or when the temperature stablises to 104 C (219 F).
After this time, the tomatoes should have a shininess and transparent look.
Prepare your jam jars.
There is a number of methods but I prefer to wash the jars, drain them well then place in the oven at 100C for 15 minutes Place the lids in a pan and boil for 10 minutes.
Pour the hot jam into the hot jars (use a jam funnel it makes it so much easier).
Seal the jars immediately and then place in a pan with a cake rack at the bottom and pour over hot water to fully submerge the jars and simmer for 10 minutes (You don't want the jars to sit directly on the bottom of the pan you can also use an old tea towel).
Remove and cool.
Using this method I have not had a problem with jam spoiling.

Remove from the heat and add the Marshmallow Fluff, peanut butter, and vanilla extract, stirring until completely smooth.
Fold in the peanuts, then pour over the bottom chocolate layer.
Smooth it into an even layer using a rubber spatula and refrigerate for another 30 minutes.
4.
For the 3rd layer: Combine the caramels and the heavy cream in a microwave safe bowl and place in the microwave so the caramels can melt.
Heat for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after every 30 seconds and continuing until smooth.
Once completely melted pour the caramel over the nougat layer and smooth the top.
Refrigerate until completely cool, about another 30 minutes.
5.
For the final chocolate layer: Repeat the same process you did when melting the chocolate and peanut butter for the first layer and spread on top of the caramel layer and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
6.
Using the parchment liner as a handle, remove the bars from the pan and cut into desired sized pieces.
If you want the full Snickers effect, you can dip them once more in chocolate from the 1st or 4th layer and place them on parchment and back into the refrigerator.

Directions as stated in magazine:.
In a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar, and salt.
Add butter, and pulse until largest pieces are the size of peas.
In a cup, combine water and vinegar; drizzle, a little at a time (just using amount needed), while pulsing, into flour mixture until a dough just starts to form (mixture will appear dry but will form a soft dough when pressed with fingers.
If dough still crumbles, pulse in a little more water mixture.
Turn dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and quickly form a ball by gathering together and pressing with hands.
Halve and wrap each piece in plastic wrap, pressing to flatten disks.
Refrigerate until ready to use.
(Can be made ahead.
Place wrapped disks in heavy-duty resealable plastic bags and freeze up to 2 months.
Thaw in refrigerator at least 5 hours before using.
).
My directions:
Place flour sugar, and salt in large bowl and stir to combine.
Using a pastry blender, cut butter (or margarine) into flour mixture, until flour mixture is crumbly and the butter (or margarine) are no longer large pieces.
Mix the cold water with vinegar (water mixture) and slowly add to flour mixture until dough starts to form.
Turn the soft dough onto a lightly floured board or pastry sheet.
Divide dough into 2 equal balls.
Roll dough between two sheets of wax paper to the size of your pie pan.
Place these in refrigerator for 10 minutes or until you are ready to use.
(Hint: I put ice in a glass with water while I measure out my dry ingredients.
Then I pour the cold water (no ice) into a measuring cup until I have 1/2 cup of cold water.
Add your vinegar and your water mixture is ready to use.
).



In a blender or food processor, combine water, papaya, sugar, and lime juice until smooth.
Pour mixture through a strainer into a pitcher, forcing through most of the pulp.
Chill at least 30 minutes before serving.
Serve with or without ice cubes.

Place oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450.
Butter a baking sheet and set aside.
In a large bowl, sift flour baking powder and salt.
Stir in cheese.
With a fork, stir in cream a little at a time until no dry bits remain and a dough has formed, may not use all the cream.
Turn the dough out on to a floured surface and knead 6 times.
Roll and cut circles out about 3/4 inches thick.
Place 1 inch apart on baking sheet.
Bake 12-15 minutes.



Wash thoroughly the liver, gizzard and heart and cover with water and cook until tender.
Drain off the water and save.
Chop the giblets fine.
Pour off most of the fat in which the poultry has been cooked, leaving about 4 tablespoon of it in the pan.
Add 3 tablespoon of flour and blend well.
Measure the giblet water adding enough water to make 3 cups.
Pour slowly into the browned flour, stirring constantly until mixture thickens.
Add giblets and cook for a few minutes.
Season with salt and pepper and serve.



Put the frozen raspberries into a blender with the sugar, and puree.
You may have to be patient as they will be difficult to blitz at first since they are extremely hard when frozen.
Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons of the raspberry puree into a each glass (3/4 cup capacity glass), top with 2 tablespoons of the yogurt and sprinkle a layer of cookie crumbs on top.
Cover the crumbs with 1 more layer of yogurt, then raspberry puree and finally cookie crumbs again.
These can be prepared the night before, in which case don't sprinkle the final layer of cookie crumbs until you are ready to eat the swirls but leave the glasses with the yogurt on top, covered with plastic wrap.



Mix together the yeast, sugar, and water, allow to sit for 30-45 minutes.
Once the water is good and bubbly (if you don't see bubbles, throw it out and try new yeast), mix the bread flour together.
Do not shape, just mix it together until everything looks wet.
Allow to sit for another 30 minutes.
Do not add more flour, and do not add the salt yet (you will do this later).
Coat your hands with flour and knead the dough for 10-15 minutes (or in a bread machine/mixer for 5 minutes).
Adjust the amount of flour/water only after kneading if necessary, the act of kneading tends to add a lot of extra flour, and you want a wet-ish dough.
Let the dough rise, covered, a minimum of 6 hours and maximum of 3 days (I've actually gone over 7 days, but the dough gets a bit crusty after a while).
If resting the dough for more than 10 hours put it in the fridge.
The longer you let the dough sit the better the flavor will be.
After the rise, gently deflate any large holes in the dough (you don't literally need to "punch it down"), and form a ball with the dough.
Pat the dough out to a rectangle.
Stretching the dough, fold it over to make a square, and sprinkle with salt.
Fold the dough again, sprinkle again.
Keep folding and sprinkling until you have added the 1 tsp (three folds tends to do it for me).
Knead the entire ball once or twice just to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.
Shape the dough as desired, I tend to split the dough into two at this point and make two baguettes.
Allow to rise until each is doubled, about an hour.
The dough is done rising when an indentation made with your finger does not spring back.
Slash (or cut) the top of the baguettes immediately before placing them in the oven.
Bake in a pre-heated 425 oven on a baking stone (if possible) for approximately 25 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom.
Spray the oven with water immediately after putting the bread in the oven, and again at 10 and 20 minutes.
After removing the bread from the oven, listen carefully for the crust to crackle.
If you hear that, grin like a madman and be very proud of yourself -- but do not touch the bread for at least 1/2 hours It's painful to wait, but well worth it!
Note: Due to the ingredients, this bread is best enjoyed the same day as baked, and will only keep for 2-3 days at most.



Beat butter till white.
Add Sugar and beat for 3 more minutes.
Add A.P.
flour, salt and beat for 2 minutes.
Garnish with 1/2 Almond or a pine (as per photo).
Roll it into small balls and slightly press it down by your thumb (with the almond to stick on it).

Put all of the ingredients into a bread machine and set to knead until smooth.
After the kneading is finished, remove the kneading blade.
Form into a slightly flat ball, (or leave as is).
Wrap the bread machine in plastic wrap.
In the summer, the bread should rise in about 6 hours indoors without air conditioning.
During the other seasons, allow it to rise for 6 hours in the bread machine on the yeast-starter setting or the bread-rising setting.
If not using the dough rising setting, it will take 8 to 10 hours in the spring and fall at 20C (room temperature), or 12 to 15 hours in the winter at less than 20C.
The yeast was a bit too strong, so this rose a bit too much, but because it's made beginning with liquid yeast and without a starter, there will be no sour taste.
Transfer the dough to a dusted work surface.
Divide and roll into balls, wrap in plastic or vinyl, then let rest for 30 minutes.
Form the rolls into your desired shape.
(I made mine into round balls.)
Wrap in plastic wrap or vinyl, and let the dough rise for a second proving.
(In the summer, it should take 60 to 70 minutes in a room without AC, and 90 minutes in the spring and fall, 120 minutes in the winter in an unheated room)
Please adjust the rising time depending on the room temperature and strength of the yeast.
The dough should rise 2.5 to 3 times in height.
Sprinkle with bread flour over the rolls, then bake for 12 minutes at 150C without letting it brown.
They're done!
You'll be surprised at the taste--it's different from bread made from dry yeast!
Your mouth will be filled with the delicious taste of flour and butter.
Or apply an egg wash, then bake for about 15 minutes at 180C to make French rolls.
You can also use this dough for making deli bread or sweet bread.



Place asparagus and onion in a saucepan with 1/2 cup vegetable broth.
Bring the broth to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer until the vegetables are tender.
Reserve a few asparagus tips for garnish; place remaining vegetable mixture in an electric blender and puree until smooth.

Stir while sprinkling flour, salt, and pepper into the margarine; do not let the flour brown.
Allow the mixture to cook only 2 minutes.
Stir in remaining 1 1/4 cups vegetable broth and increase the heat; continue stirring until the mixture comes to a boil.
Stir the vegetable puree and soy milk into the saucepan; whisk soy yogurt into the mixture, followed by lemon juice.
Stir until heated through, then ladle into bowls.
Garnish with reserved asparagus tips; sprinkle with Parmesan soy cheese if desired.
Note: Some reviewers also recommended using vanilla soy milk and/or yogurt if you like your soups sweet!

Add vanilla, combine.
Add the flour, combine.
Mix in the pecans.
Scoop out 1 tablespoon of dough, I use a cookie/ice cream scoop, shape into into a cocoon- about 2" by 1/2".
Place the cookies on cookies sheet, you can put them fairly close together as they do not rise or spread very much.I always use parchment paper on my cookies sheets.
Bake about 45 minutes, you don't really want them to be brown.
While the cookies are baking, prepare the powdered sugar.
Place some in a large bowl or container, then as you take the cookies out of the oven, layer them with powdered sugar in the bowl I just leave them in the powdered sugar until they cool.
Dig them out and tap the sugar off- this is messy but fun- I like a thick layer of sugar on mine and sifting the sugar over the cookies doesn't get them like I want.
The ones you don't eat right away keep well in an airtight container.

4.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, and gently stretch into a 12 by 6-inch rectangle.
Divide dough in half, and then cut each half into 8 pieces.
Loosely shape each piece into a ball, cover with plastic wrap or kitchen towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.
Working with one piece at a time and keeping remaining dough covered with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, set the dough on an unfloured area of work surface.
Loosely cup your hand around the dough and without applying pressure, move your hand in small circular motions to form a smooth, taut round.
Repeat with remaining pieces.
Arrange shaped rolls on two parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets and cover with plastic wrap.

Helpful tips!
*No donut shaped cookie cutter?
Use a regular cookie cutter and a small dry spice lid for the smaller hole.
*If dough is too firm after being in the fridge, let it rest at room temp for 10 min.
*The shortbread should be very pale in color.
When in doubt, underbake it!
*Coconut burns very quickly so keep an eye on it and stir often!
*Spreading the cookies with the reserved 1/4 cup of caramel gives the coconut mixture a sticky base to adhere to.

*** Since first making this bread according to the original instructions (which caused a lot of mess), I've simplified the process.
I have now bought a fairly deep plastic bowl with sloping edges, so it has a smallish bottom.
The plastic seems almost -- not quite -- non-stick, and this is the method I use now:.
In such a lightly greased plastic bowl, put the flour, and add the yeast, sugar and salt.
You may want to add less salt, but we found the original amount (1 1/4 teaspoon) not enough.
Mix through.
Add the water and stir the lot through until well mixed to a nice, smooth, quite sloppy dough.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put a kitchen terry towel or two over the top as well.
Stand in a draught-free place for 18 hours.
For me it works best to mix this up at 3pm.
This means the dough is ready at 9am the next morning and I don't even have to get up early like my grandmother did to bake those huge farm loaves in the old days.
After 18 hours the dough should be puffy and have little bubble holes on top and have more or less doubled in size, but don't worry too much about that.
Instead of -- as the original recipe said -- turning out the dough on to a towel, do the following: From the sides of the bowl, scrape the dough away with light movements and fold it over on itself with floury fingers.
Turn the bowl round and round, flattening the dough by repeating this "folding over".
LIGHTLY press a little flatter.
Cover bowl with same (now messy) plastic used before, and same terry towels.
Leave to rise again -- 2 hours long.
Half an hour before the 2 hours are up, put your oven on 450 deg F/220 deg Celsius.
(I find that in my convection - fan - oven I can use a slightly lower heat: 215 - 210C, but the difference is not important).
At the same time you need a heavy pot WITH a fitting lid, and this will go into the cold, heating-up oven, empty.
The lid is to keep in the steam and cause that wonderful crust to form.
Nothing beats an iron pot.
Le Creuset will do too, and ceramic has been mentioned.
I use a non-stick oval-shaped iron pot with a domed lid.
You do NOT need a "6 - 8 quart pot" (sounds crazy to me) as stated in the original recipe.
It's a small bread.
My iron pot is a 2 1/2 quart pot, which translates to roughly 2 1/2 litres as well.
I grease the pot and lid with REAL butter, and sometimes I slosh in some olive oil.
I don't know why, but I feel I should do it.
Now PUT THE POT IN THE OVEN, lid on.
After the 2 hours of the 2nd rising, and when the oven and pot has reached its correct heat, take out that piping hot pot very carefully (I put it on one of my oven grids on a granite surface next to the oven).
Have the covered dough nearby, and a silicone or other spatula.
Tilt the plastic bowl over the smoking pot (don't let it touch the very hot pot) and with spatula or fingers scrape the dough lightly and evenly into the hot pot.
It will sizzle as it falls into the pot; don't worry about that.
Shake the pot slightly to distribute the dough, put on the lid, and carefully shove the whole shebang into the hot oven.
Bake 30 minutes with lid, then open oven and take off lid.
Bake 15 - 30 minutes more, until your bread has a golden crust.
I find that about 15 - 20 minutes after taking off the lid the bread is ready.
Baking times will differ because ovens differ.
Turn out, and swallow that saliva until it's just cooled enough so you can saw off the end part to eat with real butter.
On your own.
When cold, do not put in plastic bag.
Use a paper bag at most.
I simply turn it on to the cut side on the breadboard, and cover it with a kitchen towel.
It lasts until it's been eaten, which doesn't take long.
Do not refrigerate, which would be silly.
***A few points: 1.
Z-mail me for questions 2.
Your experience might be "messier" than mine; it depends on the consistency of the dough and the bowl you use.
But greasing the bowl right at the start does help.
3.
Keep to the hours mentioned.
It's meant to be a sloooow rising process.
4.
Be careful not to burn yourself!
5.I have just found, praise the angels, a wonderful, very fine stone-milled 100% organic flour, and have just put a loaf of that, for the first time, in the oven!
I think this robust, Frenchified loaf just cries out for stone-milled flour, fine and creamy or almost white.
6.
You could use 2 1/2 cups white bread flour + 1/2 cup fine rye flour.
DO NOT USE wholewheat flour for this bread, except for maybe a handful: it does not have enough gluten for this bread.
Good luck!
And a warning, added months later: that pot you use MUST go into the oven empty, and must heat to the heat of the oven.
I tried putting the dough in a cold pot yesterday, and the bread wasn't as successful.
It didn't rise nearly as much, and didn't have that lovely artisanal cracked round top.
So HEAT THE POT as instructed.
MAKING A LARGER LOAF: The warning here is that I use my metric cups and spoons for this, which are very accurate!
Fortunately I have a Pyrex measuring cup with both metric millilitres and Imperial fluid ounces, so I could measure the water absolutely equally.
4 x 250 ml flour, or 1 litre or 4 cups (1 quart).
3/4 teaspoon yeast, and stir into flour.
3/4 teaspoon sugar, stir into flour.
15 ml or 3 teaspoons salt.
600 ml or 19 fluid oz water (JUST under 2 1/2 American cups -- maybe 2 teaspoons less than 2 1/2 cups).
(EDITED June 2008): My husband actually calculated -- I'm bad with maths!
-- that the water should be 666 ml -- so add a dash more than 600 ml if you feel it's necessary.
Just remember to bake this 2nd, larger recipe for the full hour.
Also, he said the bread needed more salt.
We don't eat a lot of salt and I'm not worried about the issue, so I now use 4 teaspoons, i.e.
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon).
Best results are still with white bread flour, stone-milled, or all-purpose, and a little rye flour can be used too.
Carry on as usual, grease the pot really well or pour some melted butter or olive oil into the hot pot and tilt it to grease bottom.
By the way, a silicone spatula works a treat when you tilt the dough into the super-hot pot!
YET ANOTHER NOTE: the 3-cup-flour bread is ready at plus-minus 45 minutes.
I have found that the 4-cup-bread needs a full hour.

On a floured surface, knead the flatbread dough a few times and place the dough back in the mixing bowl.
Allow dough to sit for 15 minutes.
You want the dough somewhat sticky.
Section dough into 9 equal-sized pieces.
Roll one piece into a ball, then on a floured surface, flatten it with your hands into a circle shape.
Using a rolling pin, flatten out the dough more, rolling about 5 or 6 strokes.
Heat a large skillet over medium low heat.
Do not add oil or butter, just leave it dry.
The dough will likely stick to whatever you rolled it on (despite it being floured).
Believe it or not, you want this to happen because you want your flatbread to be fairly moist.
Using a chopping knife to shimmy between your rolled flatbread and the surface its on, carefully work the dough free of the surface and place immediately in the skillet.
Cook flatbread for 5 minutes on each side, until it is golden brown.
Repeat this for all sections of dough.
Makes 9 small flatbreads.
Make extra to make room for error!

Whisk in: 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon cream of tartar.
Keep whisking until the foam is very soft, holds a slight shape, and has increased 4 to 5 times in volume.
Whisk in: 3/4 cup sugar.
Continue whisking until the mixture forms glossy, soft peaks.
The mixture should not be stiff or dry.
Transfer to a large bowl.
Sift a fine layer of the dry ingredients over the whites and fold them in with a rubber spatula, gently and quickly.
Continue sifting and folding until all the dry ingredients are incorporated.
Pour the batter into an ungreased 10- by 4-inch tube pan with a removable bottom.
Smooth the top.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes.
When done the cake should spring back when touched gently.
Invert the pan to keep the cake from sticking or deflating.
(If the cake pan has legs, turn it over onto them; otherwise invert the tube pan onto the neck of a large bottle.)
Cool completely.
To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife around the inside of the pan and around the center tube.
Gently push up the bottom, using the knife to help guide the cake out, if necessary.
Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the cake, dipping the knife into water between cuts to help keep the cake from sticking.
Add 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water or rose water to perfume the cake lightly.
For a lemon- or orange-flavored cake, add the finely grated zest of 1 lemon or 1 orange.

It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or jars where it will be ready for use.
It may be stored at room temperature for 6 weeks.
Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are already in the mix so more milk is not need.
You can use fruit juice, water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.
Add water to mix and stir 20 to 25 times.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 to 15 times.
Roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes or use biscuit cutter to make circles.

Bring milk to almost scalding, then LET COOL to body temperature [Milk is scalded by heating it to 180-185F (82C).
].
Add buttermilk.
Mix well.
Transfer to a sterile container, like glass or a thermos.
Cover and keep warm overnight.
The inside of a foam cooler is ideal.
The starter has inoculated the milk, and this will incubate the culture, thickening into real buttermilk.
Recipe may be doubled for quarts or gallons with a 1 to 4 ratio of buttermilk to milk.
If the buttermilk is very old, however, the lactic acid bacteria may have lost their ability to produce acid rapidly.
About once a week, a fresh batch of buttermilk may be made from an older batch.
Take great care to prevent contamination during the reinoculation process.
Cultures may be carried successfully through many inoculations if care is taken.
However, it is best to start with new buttermilk from the store after five or six inoculations.

In a giant mixing bowl, combine the berries with 2 cups of the sugar, being sure to coat each berry in sugar completely.
Cover the top of the berries in a blanket of the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar.
Let the berries macerate for 12 hours, stirring occasionally to help the sugar dissolve.
(Setting this up after dinner and stirring periodically before bedtime is sufficient.)
If necessary, cover the bowl loosely with a kitchen towel tied with string to protect the sweet syrup from insects.
After maceration, stir again to dissolve as much sugar as possible from the bottom of the bowl.
Set a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl and drain the syrup into it, stirring the fruit (but not pressing on it) to release as much liquid as possible.
Reserve the fruit for another use (like jam or pie filling) and taste your syrup.
Stir in the orange juice and the peppercorns and transfer the mixture to a clean, odorless glass jar with a secure lid.
Refrigerate for 5 to 6 days to allow the peppercorn flavor to develop.



Boil the garbanzo beans till very well done.
This could take up to 2 hours.

Now its time to prepare your smoker.
If you do not have a smoker, you can do this with a regular grill to get the same smoke flavor.
If you do not have a smoker, just go to the end of the directions for smoking and you will see how to do it with a grill.
I have an upright, cylinder shaped, 2 tier smoker made by Brinkman.
I buy hickory wood chunks from Home Depot or Walmart.
I will put 4 or 5 in a pan of water to soak for about an hour.
I light my coals and let them burn until the coals turn ashy of the sides.
I add my soaked wood and water pan/drip pan ontop of that.
I close the lid so it can get up to temperature.
After about half an hour, I place the ribs in the smoker (bone side down)and leave them alone for atleast 2 hours.
You want to maintain a constant temperature in the smoker of about 200 to 220 degrees.
The secret to fall-off-the-bone ribs is cooking them low and slow.
Do not even take the top off for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, take them off and wrap in aluminum foil.
Add more wet or dry wood chunks to the bottom bowl.
Close the lid and let them cook another hour and a half.
If you choose to add sauce, this is the time to do it.
Open the aluminum foil and pour my sauce over them.
After about 30 more minutes, you have the finest ribs that you have ever had!
Now, if you do not have a smoker I recommend you get one.
It's only $39 at Home Depot.
Prepare your grill with coals and place wet hickory wood chunks all around ontop of the coals.
Place ribs on the grill (bone side down) and let them cook about 30 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes.
Afterwards, wrap in aluminum foil and place back onto grill.
Let them cook an additional 30 minutes.
Pour my sticky sauce over them in the foil and let cook additional 15 minutes.
Remove and enjoy!

Soak the rice in a container that holds at least twice the volume of rice: Cover the rice with 2 to 3 inches of room-temperature water and soak for 6 to 24 hours.
If you need to shorten the soaking time, soak the rice in warm (about 100 degree) water for 2 hours.
The longer soak gives more flavor and a more even, tender texture, but the rice is perfectly edible with the shorter soak in warm water.
Drain the rice and place in a steamer basket.
Set the steamer basket over several inches of boiling water in a large pot or a wok.
The rice must not be in or touching the boiling water.
Cover and steam for 25 minutes, or until the rice is shiny and tender.
Turn the rice over after about 20 minutes, so the top layer is on the bottom.
Be careful that your pot doesn't run dry during steaming; add more water if necessary, making sure to keep it from touching the rice.
Turn the cooked rice out onto a clean work surface.
Use a long-handled wooden spoon to flatten it out a little, then turn it over on itself, first from one side, then from the other, a little like folding over dough as you knead.
This helps get rid of any clumps; after several foldings, the rice will be an even round lump.
Place it in a covered basket or in a serving bowl covered by a damp cloth or a lid.
Serve warm or at room temperature, directly from the basket or bowl.
The rice will dry out if exposed to the air for long as it cools, so keep covered until serving.

Bring the 4 ozs of yogurt to room temperature in a large glass bowl on the counter.
In a sauce pot on a moderately hot stove heat the Raw milk to 100 - 102 degrees stirring constantly and do not go over 104 degrees or you will kill the live enzymes in the raw milk.
immediately cool to about 90 degrees by placing the sauce pot on the ice cubes in the pie pan while continuing to stir.
thoroughly stir/whisk the warm milk into the yogurt and cover with the cheese cloth.
place in 100 degree oven overnight ( 8 hours) but watch that your oven doesnt cycle and spike too high - killing the enzymes and culture.
remove from oven.
use a knife and slash cut several cris-X-crosses through the yogurt to start the separating process.

Pour cream into a large, screw-top jar.
The jar should be large enough that the cream only fills it up 1/2-2/3 full.
Ensure the lid is screwed tightly onto the jar.
Shake the jar vigorously.
Keep shaking continuously.
The cream will froth up after a time and will seem to stop moving in the jar - don't worry!
Just keep shaking - over time you will see the cream start to resemble a sort of whipped cottage cheese, and then it will form a solid, yellowish mass, surrounded by an ever-growing pool of white liquid.
Shake the jar another 2-3 minutes.
In total, it will have been shook for around 25 minutes, depending on the temperature of the cream.
Suspend a fine sieve over a bowl and empty the jar contents into it.
Using a clean spoon, beat, press and fold the butter, teasing out as much liquid as you can.
Beat a pinch of salt, if desired, into the butter, and then take the mass in your hands.

Combine the vegetable oil and the baking soda in a small bowl.
It will be a somewhat thin mixture but not as thin as the real Goo Gone.
Dip the edge of a piece of paper toweling in the mixture and then rub over the sticky stuff you are trying to remove.
Keep doing this as needed.
It will probably take a couple applications, but it gets to a point where the sticky gunk starts releasing and rolling off.
Finish up by washing the item in warm soapy water.
This makes a small batch, but with using a ratio or one part vegetable oil with two parts baking soda, you may make as small or as large of a batch as you need.



In a small bowl, combine the orange juice and whole wheat flour.
Stir to blend well.
The mixture will be a soft, sticky dough.
Scrape into a large plastic container of about 2 qt capacity.
Let it stand, covered, for 12 to 24 hours.
Bubbles will begin to form visibly on the surface of the dough.
Uncover the starter and add 1 cup of the all-purpose flour and 1 cup of water.
Stir to combine.
Cover, then let stand at room temperature, 70 deg F to 72 deg F, for about 12 hours or until bubbles form on the surface.
Uncover and discard half the mixture or give to a friend.
Add 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup of water.
Cover, then let stand at room temperature, as above, for about 12 hours, or until bubbles form on the surface of the starter.
Transfer to a larger container, if necessary.
Feel the starter two more times, adding 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup water with each feeding, and allowing the starter to ferment for 12 hours at room temperature between feedings.
Discard 1/3 of the mixture and feed one more time with 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup water.
After12 to 24 hours, the starter is ready to use.
Store the starter in the refrigerator.
Feed it every four to five days with 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup water.
If you like, at every fifth feeding, discard 1/2 cup of the starter and feed with whole wheat flour instead.
Maintain by feeding at least once a week, removing it from the refrigerator and adding 1/2 cup water and 1 cup of all-purpose flour (I would be discarding half of it or so, as if you do not bake enough, you will have a gallon of starter before you know it).
Let it sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours before using.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, baking powder, and skim milk in a bowl.
Mix them together, then add in enough of the warm water to bring the mixture together into a dough.
Once you can bring the dough together, add in the vegetable oil, and knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth and elastic.
Cover the dough with a damp tea towel, or spray with water and cover with plastic wrap before setting the dough to rise for about 30 minutes.
When the dough has roughly doubled in size, gently remove the dough and place it on your work surface.
Divide the dough into portions according to how many buns you want to make.
#Keep the dough moist with a spray bottle or damp tea towel during this process.
Don't let it dry out.
Form each piece of dough into a ball, and flatten it into a disc with a rolling pin.
Add the filling and wrap it up in the dough.
Here you want to make the center of the dough a bit thicker than the edges, otherwise the juices from the filling may leak through.
Set the finished buns on some parchment paper, and line them up in a steamer, leaving space between the buns so that they don't stick together.
Spray the buns so they do not dry out, and leave them to rise for about 15 minutes.
Once they have finished rising, steam the buns over boiling water for 15 minutes (high heat).
Once the buns are steamed, you are done!!
!
If you do not have a steamer basket, you can steam these buns in a pot.
Just be sure to place a tea towel between the top of the pot and the lid, and to leave the lid a tiny bit open.
This will keep the buns from getting too wet.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat the butter and maple syrup together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.
Stir the flour and salt together in a separate bowl; gradually mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just incorporated.
Form the mixture into walnut-sized balls; flatten gently and arrange onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.



Sift together the flour and salt; sift again.
Cut in the shortening or lard with a pastry blender or two knives until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
Add ice water a tablespoon at a time (approximately 3 tablespoons in all), stirring the dough around the bowl with a fork.
As soon as it is moist enough to gather into a ball, wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.
Handle the dough as little as possible.
Roll half of the pastry dough out on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness.
The pastry should be about 1 1/2 inches larger than the the pie plate.
Repeat with the other half of dough for a double crust pie, or freeze the remaining dough for a future pie.
Makes enough for a double crust for a 9- or 10-inch pie, or two single crusts.
My Note: I trusted this one and had a wonderful result.
The juices from the filling didn't even make the crust soggy.
Like some PotPie Do.
* If recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, prick the pie shell with a fork and bake in a preheated 350*F. oven for about 3 minutes; remove from the oven and prick some more if the crust is puffing up.
Return to the oven and bake 5 minutes longer.
Place on a wire rack to cool, then fill as recipe directs.
* For best results, refrigerate all ingredients prior to making the dough - even the flour.
*Use pastry flour or all-purpose.
Bread flour has too much gluten to make a tender crust, and cake flour is too soft to give the proper body.
*Lard and shortening produce the most tender crusts.
You may use half lard or shortening and half butter if you want the buttery flavor.
*The pockets of fat make the flakiness in the crust.
Use a pastry blender or 2 knives to cut in fat.
Dough should still have some pea-size pieces.
Handle as little as possible with your hands.
*All liquids should be ice-cold.
*For a flakier crust, substitute ice cold sour cream or heavy cream for the water.
*Sugar in a pastry dough sweetens and tenderizes.
*Blend liquid in just until the dough begins to hold together.
Overworking toughens the dough.
*Chill the dough for 30 minutes for easier rolling.
*To prevent a soggy crust, refrigerate for 15 minutes before filling or seal by brushing with slightly beaten egg white, then refrigerate for 15 minutes.
*Setting the pie pan on a metal baking sheet during baking also helps prevent soggy crusts.
*Enhance the flavor of your dough by adding spices such as nutmeg, ginger, or cinnamon.
*Meringue won't "weep" if you blend a teaspoon of cornstarch into the sugar before beating it into the egg whites.
*Sprinkle toasted ground nuts or fine cookie crumbs over the dough and gently press them in before filling or baking.
** How to Freeze Pie Crust Dough **
Take some of the work out of making pie by making your pie crusts ahead and freezing them.
Here's how:.
Option 1:.
1.
Make up the dough for your pie crust, following the instructions in the recipe that you've chosen.
2.
Then, form the dough into a ball; and place it in a freezer bag, or wrap it in a double layer of plastic wrap.
Label and date it.
Note: If your pie crust recipe makes more than one crust, divide the dough into individual pie amounts before freezing.
4.
Store your dough in the freezer for up to three months.
To Use: Thaw your pie dough in the fridge overnight.
Then, roll it out as usual.
Option 2:.
1.
Make your dough; roll it out; and form your crust in a pie plate.
2.
Then, stick the whole thing pie plate and all in a freezer bag.
To Use: Thaw your pie crust in the refrigerator overnight, and proceed with your pie recipe; or use your crust frozen, and simply add a couple minutes to the normal bake time.
Tips: Keep a couple pie crusts in the freezer at all times for easy last-minute desserts.
Think about making your pie filling ahead, too.
Make your pie crusts in disposable pie plates, so you can make a bunch at once (this will also make them easy to stack in the freezer).
*And practice!
Every time you make a pie crust from scratch, it will get easier.
Soon it will take only a few minutes - less time than letting a refrigerated crust soften at room temperature.
And the cost savings are really tremendous.
Have fun experimenting!

It helps to place an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf while the oven is heating, not the same as a pizza stone, but better than just a tray on its own!
Put the flour into a large bowl, and then stir in the yeast and salt.
Make a well in the centre and pour in 200 ml warm water and the olive oil, bringing together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft fairly wet dough.
You may need to adjust the flour/water ratio as all flours absorb the water differently.
Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5mins until smooth.
Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.
Roll out the dough.
If you have let it rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.
On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25 cms across, using a rolling pin.
The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.
Put the rounds onto thick baking sheets dusted with flour, add your favourite toppings and bake in the pre-heated oven for 8-10 minutes till crisp.

Heat until hot; test by breaking off a little piece of green bean and dropping it into the oil.
Instant frying means it's hot enough.
You can use your hands to drop the beans into the oil, I prefer tongs just to be safe.
Only add enough beans to sit comfortably in the hot oil without overcrowding.
Move them around a bit; flip them and cook until they are shriveled and a few are slightly browned.
Remove from wok with tongs; drain oil from wok; return the beans to the wok; reduce the heat but keep it hot.
Shake on as much oyster sauce as you like, adding a couple large pinches of sesame seeds or more also as you like.

NOTE: It is very important to press and dry the tofu well, otherwise, this will be a big sloppy mess instead of crumbles.
Combine all ingredients EXCEPT TOFU in a pan and simmer gently for 5-10 minutes, just until the sauce becomes slightly thick.
Set aside the sauce to cool a bit.
While the sauce is cooling, crumble the pressed and dried tofu into a bowl.
Toss the tofu with a bit of the cooled sauce, adding sauce in small increments until the tofu is uniformly colored, but with no liquid at the bottom of the bowl.
You will have some leftover sauce that you can refrigerate and use later.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Put parchment down on a sheet pan and carefully spread the sauced tofu on it.
Bake until the tofu looks dry and a bit crumbly, but be careful not to overcook or burn it.
As the tofu bakes, turn it over occasionally with a spatula to help the "drying" process.
Baking should take at least 20 minutes, but may take much longer depending on how well you were able to press out the water.
When the tofu crumbles appear sufficiently dry, take them out of the oven and add them to sauteed peppers, bean sprouts, celery, mushrooms, spinach, eggs, or whatever!

Bake using french bread cycle if your machine has it.
If not, use the dark crust white cycle.
Start with 2 3/4 cups flour, you might need more depending on a lot of factors.
My favorite way to get the texture I like is about 10 minutes into the knead cycle I will pinch a good size chunk of dough between my thumb and two or three fingers.
If it feels just moist and some dough sticks to my fingers, it's just right.
If no dough sticks, it's a bit dry and add a few teaspoons of water.
If it feels too soft and very sticky, add more flour until you get the right consistency after about another 5 minutes of kneading.

The seeds will plump up and soften after soaking up the liquid.
Add sugar/honey and salt.
You can make a honey mustard by adding extra honey.
Brown sugar is nice too!
Process in a food processor or blender to desired consistency.
For something Dijon-like, process to a paste, or you could even choose to leave the mustard seeds whole.
I usually go for somewhere in between.
Adjust sweetness and saltiness if necessary.
Transfer to a glass jar (glass is better because plastic and metal can add weird flavors to the mustard).
Let the mustard sit for a few days to "ripen" in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
It will be a little bitter at first, but this will go away after aging.
Letting it sit at room temperature will result in a spicier mustard and refrigerating will stop the formation of spicy compounds.
Again, adjust and try it as it goes until you get the flavor you like!
Refrigerate for up to 2 months.



NOTE:
This is best if you use only pure cranbery juice, not those cranberry juice cocktail "juices" on the market.

If you want to make these with your kids, all you need is ice cream, chocolate and some fun decorations.
Use an ice cream scooper to scoop out balls of ice cream (shape further into balls by wrapping in plastic wrap and forming into balls with your hands).
Place balls on a baking sheet or large freezer safe plate lined with parchment or waxed paper, store in your freezer for at least one hour or until ready to use.
When ready to dip the balls, melt some chocolate (either in the microwave or with a double boiler).
You can use chocolate chips or melting disks from the craft store.
Once the chocolate is melted, dip away; the chocolate will begin to firm up due to the cold ice cream, so we did it in batches of 3.
We pulled a third of the ice cream balls out, coated them in the chocolate then decorated.
Then the next third and so forth.
Once the ice cream balls are coated in chocolate, have the kids quickly decorate as soon as they are dipped, because the chocolate will harden quickly.
Yes its a bit messy and no they will not look perfect, but guess whatits fun, fun, fun!
And the kids will LOVE it.
We did some plain; just the fact that the ice cream was shaped like a ball was fun to them.
Some we rolled in sprinkles alone and some were dipped in chocolate and decorated.
You could make small ones as well with a melon scooper.
Have fun and get messy.
After all, when a kid ends up messy, that usually means they had FUN!
Enjoy!

Choose sprouts that are heavy with moisture.
Avoid those that feel light.
They could be old and dried out.
Wash sprouts with vegetable/produce wash to remove any viruses, bacteria or harmful pesticides.
Rinse sprouts and drain in colander.
Cut off base/stem of each sprout.
Do not waste too much.
Compost the stems.
Cut each sprout into quarters.
Place in an iron skillet or another oven safe skillet.
Drizzle with olive oil.
You may use more or less as per your taste or health needs.
Add some grey sea salt.
The grey has more trace minerals and is healthier.
I like the extra fine velvet style.
Its wet so it takes some shaking to get it out.
Use only what you feel comfortable with, especially if you have blood pressure issues.
Place skillet under broiler flame at high for 3 to 5 minutes.
I have a broiler separate from my oven.
If you only have the oven, you wont get the exact same effect.
Try putting them up high if the element is at the top of your oven.
SET A TIMER!!
These babies can scorch.
Use tongs to grab and toss well.
Set under the broiler flame again and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes depending on strength/heat of your broiler.
Toss again.
The outer leaves should be browning.
They can go to a nice dark brown.
Do not let them blacken.
Some prefer a medium brown color.
Just keep checking on them.
And tossing.
Repeat the broiling and tossing process to cook all sides evenly, distribute oil/salt and get lots of browning.
The broiling and salt removes that horrid, bitter taste.
Use caution: sprout haters like me will become addicts instantly.
Thanks go to Suzanne Skinas who taught me to make these.
They have a nice toasty flavor that actually brings out the few sugar molecules that must be in there somewhere!
I like them toasty and very crispy.
The outer leaves will flake off and create a nicely textured and colored dish.
Serve hot out of the skillet to the plates.
A toaster oven is also perfect for this if you have no broiler.
The hot element will toast them nicely.
But, make sure to toss them often!
Just watch them.
The burn sneaks up on you.
You think since they are a green veggie you can turn your back.
But you cant.
This is one way I can eat a super food, i.e., anti-cancer, I used to detest.
Buon appetito!



Add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the milk and bring it to a boil.
The lemon juice will separate the milk into watery whey and solid chunks.
Sift mixture through a clean muslin cloth and throw away the water.
It will take about 15 minutes for all of the water to be removed.
Blend solid chunks in blender with cardamon into a thick paste.
You can add a FEW drops of water if needed but you want as thick of a paste as possible.

Put the water and miso in a small pan, and heat up until just before it begins to boil.
By killing the micro-organisms in the miso this way, the dough won't be so loose and will be much easier to handle.
Once the miso cools down, add enough water so that the mixture comes to 105 to 115 g, because some water will have evaporated.
Put all the ingredients in a bread machine.
Select the knead-only program, knead for 7 minutes only, then stop the program!
Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl.
Don't over knead this dough!
Leave to rise properly, until the dough has increased by 2 1/2 to 3 times in volume.
The dough will contain lots of air bubbles at this point, so wait patiently.
Take the dough out very gently so as not to lose those bubbles and place onto a flour dusted work surface.
Round it off lightly and leave to rest for 15 minutes.
If you want to divide it into 2, do so at this stage.
I formed the loaves into long thin baguettes following bread master Tsukakei's instructions.
Form into shapes with canvas or something similar and leave to rise again (2nd rising).
They have risen enough when they have doubled in size.
Preheat the oven with the baking sheets inside.
Slash the tops of the loaves with a knife, mist with water, and put into the oven with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking sheet.
My oven doesn't have a steam function, so I put in some glass containers filled with boiling water along with the bread.
My oven is rather weak, so I bake it at 250 C for 30 minutes, but please adjust the time and temperature to your own oven.
Baked.
The slash got puffy and expanded.
How the inside looks.
It tastes cheesy rather than like miso.
It's a bit sour and has a deep flavor.
The air bubbles are so-so...Since it contains miso, the crumb is a bit brown.
It smells rather like there's rye flour in the bread!
The crust is thin and crispy, very nice.
I tried making this one using the autolyse method (mixing the flour and water together and letting it sit for a while before adding the yeast etc.
)The bread was springy and aromatic and had a great texture.



Mix thoroughly butter, sugar and vanilla.
Work in flour, salt and nuts until dough holds together.

Stir occasionally with a wooden spatula until the color of the mixture changes to amber, around 20 minutes.
Remove toffee from heat, carefully spread it evenly over the baking sheet with a spatula.
Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot toffee and allow to sit for a few minutes to soften.
Gently spread the chocolate to thinly coat the top of the toffee.
Sprinkle the almonds over the chocolate layer.
Use a sheet of clean parchment paper to gently pat the almonds into the chocolate.
Place the toffee into the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to harden.
Once chilled, carefully remove the toffee from the pan by lifting the hangs of the parchment paper, and break into pieces.



Cook greens in a 6- to 8-quart pot of , uncovered, until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes.

Remove turkey from refrigerator several hours before cooking.
Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.
Reserve the turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock.
Pull out the pads of yellow fat at both sides of the tail and discard.
(These are sometimes already removed by the processor, so don't worry if they aren't present.)
If desired, rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water.
Pat the turkey skin dry.
Turn the turkey on its breast.
Loosely fill the neck cavity with stuffing.
Using a thin wooden or metal skewer, pin the turkey's neck skin to the back.
Fold the turkey's wings akimbo behind the back (the tips will rest behind the turkey's "shoulders") or tie to the body with kitchen string.
Loosely fill the large body cavity with stuffing and cover the stuffing with a small piece of aluminum foil.
Place any remaining stuffing in a lightly buttered casserole, cover and refrigerate to bake as a side dish.
Place the drumsticks in the hock lock or tie together with kitchen string.
Brush the turkey all over with the butter.
Mix together the salt and pepper and season the turkey all over.
Tightly cover the breast area (but not the wings) with foil.
Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in the roasting pan.
Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the bottom of the pan.
Roast the turkey, basting all over every 45 minutes with the juices on the bottom of the pan (lift up the foil to reach the breast area), until a meat thermometer inserted in the meaty part of the thigh (but not touching a bone) reads 180 degrees F and the stuffing is at least 165 degrees F, about 4 1/4 hours.
(See estimated roasting times below.)
Whenever the drippings evaporate, add broth to moisten them, one cup at a time, as needed.
During the last hour of the roasting time, remove the foil and baste at least once to allow the skin to brown.
Transfer the turkey to a large serving platter and let it stand at least 40 minutes before carving (it will not cool off; this allows the hot juices to retract back into the turkey meat), which gives you plenty of time for making the gravy and for finishing any other last-minute dishes.
Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 180 to 185 degrees F.

Place a skillet over high heat and drop in the butter.
You will start to see the butter bubble a little bit, but wait until it gets little caramelized bits in it.
At that point you have made brown butter.
Remove from heat.
Using a rubber spatula, and being careful to get every last drop you possibly can, pour the butter into a plastic container.
Place the container, uncovered, in the freezer so as to let the butter set up.
This shouldnt take too long, but I gave you a wide berth of time in the prep time just in case something goes just a tad bit wrong.

Note: Substitute orange juice for rum, if desired.



Ingredients should be at room temperature.
Mix peanut butter and molasses to a thick paste.



Note: The listed prep time is simply for preparing the dough.
The dough then needs to be refrigerated for 2-24 hours before slicing.
Toast the nuts on a dry pan in a 350 F oven for 10-15 minutes until aromatic and flavorful.
While the nuts are toasting, coarsely chop then cover the Craisins with boiling water in a small bowl.
Let them soak/soften for 10-15 minutes.
Drain, pat dry and allow Craisins and nuts to cool while proceeding with next steps.
In a medium sized bowl, beat butter, salt, black and red pepper until fluffy.

Good luck keeping them around for very long.
They disappear quickly!
The baby shower I was attending had lots of sweets planned, so I wanted to bring something savory.
Shortbread cookies are a favorite of ours, so removing the sugar and adding crunchy nuts, sweet/tart Craisins and pungent sharp cheese really fit the bill.
These were a huge hit and the only complaint was that people couldnt stay out of them!



Bring about 3 cups water to a boil.
Put the couscous in a bowl, sprinkle with the salt, and cover with enough of the boiling water to cover by about an inch.
Let sit for about 30 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.
If you are short on time, you can skip the last step of this recipe and merely sprinkle the couscous with water and put it in the microwave for a minute or two, always separating the grains with your fingers before serving.
Drizzle the oil over the grains, and gently rub them with your fingers to break apart any lumps.
Let sit for another 15 minutes.
Then, if you want, steam the couscous.
Set a couscoussier or a cheesecloth-lined vegetable steamer in a stockpot with a few inches of simmering water, broth, or soupy stew.
The couscous should sit not in the liquid but, rather, a few inches above it.
Try to keep the steam from escaping from the sides of the pot.
Set a timer for 15 minutes once you start seeing steam rise through the couscous.



In a large pot, melt half of the butter on medium heat.
Add the onions and sweat until the onions are translucent, 3 minutes.
Add the chili powder, garlic salt and paprika, and saute for 2 minutes.
Add the ketchup, molasses, honey, mustard, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.
Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Transfer the sauce to a blender or use an immersion blender and blitz, leaving some texture to the sauce.
Fold in the remaining butter.



Mix the almonds, pecans, and walnuts in a small bowl and set them aside.
Place the white sugar, brown sugar, and salt in a 10" nonstick skillet, mix well until combined.
Add the corn syrup and turn the heat to medium high.
When the mixture begins to bubble, about 1 minute, stir well for a couple minutes to combine the corn syrup and completely dissolve the sugars.
Add the mixed nuts and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes, until all liquid is absorbed and the nuts are well coated.
Move to a clean dish.
When the nuts are cool enough to handle, separate the clumps, and allow them to dry for a couple hours.
They will still retain their sticky surface, and you'lll have to pry them off the dish.
But that's half the fun!



1.
Place chopped lettuce in a large bowl; layer cucumber, onion, radishes, and avocado on top of lettuce.
Sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the avocado; refrigerate 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.2.
Pour vinegar over salad, tossing gently to coat.
Gradually add oil, salt, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper to salad; toss well.
Sprinkle with sunflower seed kernels.



Preheat the oven to 350F (175C).
In a small mixing bowl, stir together the egg whites, sugar, and vanilla.
Stir in the salt and half of the flour, then mix in the melted butter.
Beat in the rest of the flour until smooth.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread 2 level tablespoons of the batter into a circle 6 inches (15 cm) across.
Try to get the circles as even and smooth as possible (youre likely to get 2 rounds on one standard baking sheet).
Put the baking sheet in the oven and begin checking the cones after about 10 minutes.
Depending on your oven, theyll take between 10 and 15 minutes to bake.
The circles should be a deep golden brown throughout (some lighter and darker spots are inevitable, so dont worry).
Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Use a thin metal spatula to loosen the edge of one disk.
Slide the spatula under the disk, quickly flip it over, and immediately roll it around the cone-rolling form, pressing the seam firmly on the counter to close the cone and pinching the point at the bottom securely closed.
Let the cone cool slightly on the mold until it feels firm, then slide it off and stand it upright in a tall glass to cool.
Roll the other cone the same way.
(If its too firm, return the baking sheet to the oven for a minute or so until its pliable again.)
Repeat, using the remaining batter.
Youll find it easier to spread the batter if you slide the reusable parchment paper off the baking sheet; any heat from the baking sheet will make the batter fussy to spread.
For Sesame or Poppy Seed Ice Cream Cones, stir 3 tablespoons (35 g) toasted sesame or poppy seeds and a bit of grated lemon zest into the batter.
To make Chocolate Ice Cream Cones, increase the sugar to 1/2 cup (100 g), and use 6 tablespoons (60 g) flour and 3 tablespoons (21 g) unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder in place of the 2/3 cup (90 g) flour.
For Gingersnap Ice Cream Cones, add 1 tablespoon mild molasses and 1/4 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg to the batter.
Increase the sugar to 1/2 cup (100 g).
For Honey-Cornmeal Ice Cream Cones, substitute 1 large egg and 1 egg white for the 1/4 cup (60 ml) egg whites.
Melt 2 teaspoons of strongly flavored honey with the butter, and substitute 1/2 cup (70 g) of flour and 1/4 cup (35 g) of stone-ground cornmeal for the 2/3 cup (90 g) flour.
For Rosemary Ice Cream Cones, add 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary to the Honey-Cornmeal Ice Cream Cone batter.
The batter can be made up to 4 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
Let the batter come to room temperature before using.
Once baked and cooled, store the cones in an airtight container until ready to serve.
Theyre best eaten the same day theyre baked.

Grease a pan or dish to pour the fudge into to set.
Sift together the cocoa and milk powder.
Place the sugar and water together in a saucepan and bring to boil.
Stir continuously till the sugar syrup has reached one string consistency (to test this, lift a small amount of syrup up and let it drip back into the pan; if it falls in a 'string' then it's done).
Turn off the heat without removing the saucepan off the stove and add the butter to the sugar syrup- the butter should melt in the heat of the pan but if it doesn't, have the stove on at the lowest temperature.
Add the sifted cocoa and milk powder to the butter and syrup and mix together until the mixture is smooth.
If you want harder fudge then keep stirring for longer, having the heat on low but if you want it softer, then stop stirring and take it off the stove.
Pour the fudge into the pre-greased pan, scraping off any of the mixture that will not pour.
Making sure your hands are clean, grease the fleshy part of your hands and press the mixture down evenly and smoothly.
While still unset, cut it small pieces.

Add the liquid ingredients to the dry, tossing with a fork until it comes together.
If it seems to require more liquid to come together, add a little extra milk.
Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and fold it over gently 10-12 times until smooth (I found a metal bench scraper to be quite helpful here).
Divide the dough in half, and form each half roughly into a rectangular shape.
Work with one half at a time, keeping the other half covered.
On the counter, lightly flour one of your parchment sheets and a rolling pin.
Roll one piece of dough on the parchment, adding a little more flour as necessary, into a rectangle about 10&#8243; X 14&#8243; (almost the size of your parchment).
The dough should be about 1/16&#8243; thick.
Trim the edges to make a clean rectangle and dock evenly with a fork.
Using a pizza or pastry wheel, cut the dough into 16 rectangles.
Lift the parchment onto your baking sheet.

There are two ways you could do the cooking and peeling of the potatoes; it just depends on where you want to spend your time.
1.
You could peel them and cut them into quarters then place in a pot with water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring them to a boil and boil until fork tender.
2.
You could wash them and place them whole in a pot with water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring them to a boil until fork tender.
It will take them longer to boil, but once they are cooked and cooled enough to handle, you can simply peel the skins off using your hands or a small paring knife.
Using desired method, boil potatoes until fork tender.
Drain water from the pot and place peeled potatoes back in the pot and over medium-low heat on the stove.
Add 5 tablespoons butter, milk, 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of remaining salt (depending on your tastes), and ground pepper to the pot.
Mash potatoes using a wooden spoon or potato masher.

Equipment: 12 or more 6-ounce or 8-ounce glasses 12 or more pieces cellophane, 12 by 12-inches (15 by 15-inches if using 8 ounce cups) 1 to 2 cookie sheets
Place the chocolate in individual bowls and place each one over simmering water (a little lower temperature for white chocolate) to melt.
Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator.
To make the molds, place the cup in the center of a piece of cellophane and bring the cellophane up the walls of the glass.
Fold it over the rim, stuffing the excess inside the glass.
This will make loose pleats around the glass.
Adjust the cellophane so the pleats are not too tight, otherwise the chocolate may break when you try to peel the cellophane from it.
Make extra molds in case you have breakage.
Hold the rim of the cello wrapped glass and dip it in the melted chocolate as deep in as you want the chocolate cup to be.
Remove it from the chocolate, turn it upside down, and place it on a sheet pan in the refrigerator.
Allow to chill and harden for 1 hour or more.
Remove the glasses from the refrigerator one at a time.
Use a sharp scissors to trim around cellophane just below the rim.
Try to avoid touching the chocolate with your fingers, as it will melt instantly.
Pull the cellophane towards and against the glass to support the chocolate while you remove it from the glass.
Hold the cup at the base with your left hand (if your hands are warm hold the cup with a piece of waxed paper) and with your right hand pull the cellophane down and away from the chocolate and into the center of the cup.
Snip off the excess cellophane.
Place the cup back in the refrigerator for now while you trim the rest of the cups.
Once they're all trimmed, remove them one at a time.

Rinse the ribs under cold water and allow to sit at room temperature while you make the rub.
Mix the Paprika, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Chilli Powder, Oregano, Basil, Ground Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper to make the rub.
Using a basting brush put a thin layer of the yellow mustard on both sides of the rack.
Sprikle the rub onto both sides in as even a coat as possible.
Preheat your grill to 225 F leaving one side of the grill off.
Take your time doing this and make sure the temperature stays within 5 F to allow even cooking temperature.
Place the racks of ribs on the side of the grill with no direct heat with the bone side down.
Cook ribs for 4 - 6 Hours depending on your grill.
About 30 minutes before you remove the ribs, baste them with the Bbq sauce and allow to turn into a glaze on the ribs.
Remove the ribs and cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes before eating to allow the meat to rest.

When completely cool place in cookie tins.



Pour the oil into a saucepan.
Slide it over medium heat and get the oil nice and hot.
Whisk in the flour.
Cook, whisking constantlyit will be a bit grainy at first.
Soon the flour will start turning color.
This will deepen with every passing minute.
Youre aiming to get a nice chocolate brown color and a rich, nutty, toasted smell.
So open up your senses and keep whisking.
Once the roux reaches the perfect color and smell, pull the pan off the heat and keep whisking as it cools down a bit.
It will get thinner and smoother.
Use the roux right away or pour it into a plastic container and let it cool down completely.
Refrigerate til you need it.



Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In large bowl, sift together dry ingrediants.
Gradually add enough cream to form a soft dough.

Pour into well buttered rectangular pyrex or oven roasting pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or till lightly browned on top and skewer comes out clean.
Cooks Note: After reading a review from someone, I think perhaps they went for a high cake.
Aim for a flatter rather than high cake.
So your pyrex or roasting pan should be flatter rather than deeper or higher.
Eggless cakes fare poorly when you try to bake them in deep/high dishes instead of flat, as they dont have eggs to help them rise.
This could lead to rawness in the centre, whereas a flatter cake would cook evenly.



pour all ingredients over ice.
shake over ice.
serve in a chilled/frosted martini glass.



Combine honey and water; stir until blended.
To prevent browning, soak apples, pears or other fruit for 30 seconds.



Note : at step 2 you can add a couple drops of vanilla extract (or any other aroma), and/or a couple dashes of cinnamon and/or other spices to vary the taste.
Btw you can really use whatever nuts/seeds and dried fruit you want!
I like pumpkin seeds and coconut with apricot and cranberries.
Place all ingredients in a blender for 2 minutes, or until it starts to form clumps and pieces of fruit are barely visible.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and work it with your hands to see if it sticks together when pressed hard.
If not, add water, a couple drops at a time, until it does.
Form into 16 half-ounce balls.
You can store them on top of eachother in a container, they won't stick together and won't loose their shape if you carry them.
I recommend refrigerating them overnight to let the flavours blend a little and the texture set.

As the batter gets crumbly, knead and roll it into a long stick then wrap it with the cling wrap and leave the dough for about 10-15 minutes.
Unwrap the dough and cut into your preferred bite size.
It would be nice if you cut it using the cookie cutter.
I don't have one, so after cutting it using the normal knife, I had to roll the small piece once again so that it has a better looking cookie shape.
Arrange the slices on a baking sheet or aluminum foil about 1-2 inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm but not browned, 180F C for about 15 minutes.

You'll need a non-stick Teflon pan and put it on the burner and turn the heat on low for one minute
Once the pan has heated add the sugar, and turn the heat to a medium high heat, just leave the sugar alone and let it sit until it starts to caramelize around the edges.
DO NOT STIR THE SUGAR!
!
When the sugar start to caramelize, you'll see the sugar begin to liquify, pick up the pan by the handle and slowly rotate the pan above the burner in either direction so that the granulated sugar melts into the caramelized sugar.
You can return the pan to the burner so that it gets bubbly.
Be careful not to use high heat as it will burn the sugar.
The caramelized sugar will start to turn a yellowish color, once it turns a brown you can turn the burner off and let it stand for 2 minutes
After the caramelized sugar has set for two minutes the sugar should be liquidy enought to stir.
After you can start to use whatever tools you have to make your spun sugar designs.
Have some parchment paper or wax paper laid out as your work surface.
Be very careful the sugar is hot.
The sugar starts to harden an cool fast so you can return the pan back to the burner giving it a blast of heat to help loosen it.
I myself used a metal ladle, large metal mixing spoon, metal spatula without the holes.
I turned them all upsides down.
Using a wooden spoon you slowly drizzled the sugar over the backs of your utensils and let it set.

If upon cooling the cracker remains slightly pliable, you may return it to the pan for further cooking, or possibly place in a preheated 350 F. oven for a few min, till fully "dry out."
Yield: 6.
VARIATIONS: For a crunchier cracker, add in 1/3 c. buckwheat groats and increase the water slightly.
Buckwheat has a strong flavor.
According to your taste, you may wish to increase the all-purpose flour and decrease the amount of buckwheat.



Place the sugar in a frying pan and heat until it starts melting, stir in the margarine.
When golden, remove from heat, add potatoes, rolling them carefully around so they are completely covered with caramel.



Pour milk in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.
Remove from the heat and let it cool to 105 degrees F, about 15 minutes.
In a medium bowl stir together the whole wheat flour and yeast.
Stir in the cooled milk and mix until thoroughly combined.
Set mixture aside for 30 minutes.
Stir the butter, honey, and salt into the milk mixture.
Add the bread flour and stir vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes until totally combined.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it stand at room temperature for at least 8 hours.
Dust a work surface with 1 tablespoon of the cornmeal and a little flour.
Deflate the dough, transfer it to the work surface, and shape it into a rectangle.
Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a 10x8-inch rectangle.
Dust the top of the dough with 2 teaspoons of the cornmeal.
Using a 3-1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 5 to 6 muffins.
Re-roll the dough scraps to 3/8 inch thick.
Cut out 1 to 2 more muffins in the same way.
Re-roll the last bit of dough to cut out 1 or 2 more muffins.
Dust muffins with the remaining teaspoon of cornmeal.
Cover the rounds with plastic wrap and let them rest for 15 minutes.
Position a rack in the center of the oven, and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it.
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat until hot, about 5 minutes.
Place four of the rounds on the griddle.
Cook, flipping once with a spatula, until the tops and bottoms of the muffins are browned and firm but the edges remain soft, about 4 minutes per side.
Be sure to check the bottoms.
You will probably be toasting these later and you dont want them too dark.
Transfer the muffins to the baking sheet in the oven for 5 minutes to finish cooking.
Brown the next batch of muffins and then place them on the baking pan in the oven.
After the first batch has cooked for 5 minutes, remove from the oven allowing the second batch to keep on baking until their 5 minutes is reached.
Remove muffins to a rack and let each batch cool for 1 to 2 minutes.

Place pumpkin and sunflower seeds on a large baking sheet.
Roast seeds at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes.
Cool seeds for 1 hour.
In a large bowl, combine seeds, dried fruit, chocolate, and salt.
Serve.



Heat oven to 425 degrees.
Mix the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.
I cut the butter in cold with my fingers, crumbling it until no pieces larger than a pea remain but there are still lots of nice little bits of butter.
Pour in the buttermilk and mix with a wooden spoon until just well combined, no more, no less.
After mixing scrape your biscuit dough out onto a well floured work surface.
Sprinkle lightly with flour and dust your hands with flour.
Use as little as you can to keep it from sticking to everything.
Gently form it into a rectangle with the narrow end facing you.
Roll this out to 1" thick with a rolling pin.
Roll from the center using a light bouncing motion.
Don't bulldoze the dough.
A gentle touch is key.
You can use your hands to pat it out instead of a rolling pin, but I prefer using a pin.
Fold it into thirds by folding the farthest end towards you then folding it again, like a business letter.
Turn clockwise.
Roll this back out to about 1 1/2" thick and fold it in half.
Turn clockwise once more, roll out, fold in half, and then form the dough into a nice round circle.
Roll the circle out to about 1" thick.
Cut biscuits using a floured biscuit cutter (tip: to get the flour to stick to the cutter I smear just a bit of biscuit dough on the inside of it and then flour it, reflouring after cutting each biscuit -- and remember, don't twist your biscuit cutter or you'll seal the sides).
Place them on a parchment lined baking sheet.
You can brush the tops of your biscuits with butter or cream if you want.
Bake for about 15 minutes for 3" diameter biscuits.
Cool slightly.
Peel back the tender, flaky layers.
Slather with cinnamon-sugar butter.
Or jam.
Or nothing.



Toss all that in a jar and SHAKE IT!
Good for 6 to 8 lbs of meat or seafood.

Notes on oats: I use a more finely-rolled, organic oat.
Otherwise use quick oats or try grinding your rolled oats a bit.
Mix together the first four ingredients.
If doubling, tripling, etc., mix each in its own bowl / bag.
I know this seems silly but if you do it all together and then divide into servings, the sugar and salt will end up mostly in the last one!
If saving for future, keep in small containers or plastic baggies.
When ready to eat, pour into a bowl.
Add fully boiling water- start with 1/3 cup, and stir it well.
If you like it thinner, add more just a spoonful at a time, stirring till you get the consistency you want.
Cover and wait just a minute for the oats to soak up all the water.
(This is optional, but reccommended.)
Devour!
I like to top mine with berries; stir in diced apple or pear BEFORE adding water; try different nuts, etc.
This is just a base really, but a darn good one!



Chop the sunflower seeds in a food processor.
Mix in the remaining ingredients and form the patties.
Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

Place biga in a large bowl, add 1/4 cup ice cold water and mix on low speed with paddle until smooth, add yeast mixture, salt and remaining 3/4 cup ice cold water, mix until blended.
Add 2 3/4 cups flour and beat on medium speed until well blended.
Change to dough hook and beat on medium speed until very smooth and elastic, about 12 - 15 minutes (dough will be very sticky).
Scrape dough into an oiled 2 quart bowl, wrap with plastic wrap and let rise until tripled in size, about 3 hours.
Sprinkle board generously with flour and scrape dough onto it.
With floured hands, gently fold in half and pinch a seam, turn over and form into a 12 - 13 inch smooth log.
Lightly sprinkle with flour, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand until puffy, about 30 minutes.
While dough is rising, place a large baking stone (or large baking sheet) in oven and set to 425F, let heat at least 30 minutes.
Flour a 14" x 17" piece of stiff cardboard or unedged baking sheet and gently lift dough onto it, stretching dough out to about 16 inches long.
Shake floured board or sheet to slide dough diagonally onto baking stone or baking sheet.
Bake until deep golden brown, about 30 - 35 minutes.

Prepare the squash by quartering, then cut off the ends and scrape out the seeds.
Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife.
Be very careful!
The squash rind is tough and awkward to work with.
Cut the peeled squash into 2-inch chunks.
Place into a large sauce pan or Dutch oven and add the broth.
Cover and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and boil until tender, about 15-20 minutes.
While squash is cooking, in a large skillet, place the diced onion, butter, brown sugar and salt.
Saute onion over medium-high heat until golden brown and caramelized, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir into the cooked squash.
In a blender container, blend squash, onions and liquid in 2 or 3 batches.
Liquefy until smooth.
Be very careful when blending the hot mixture!
Only fill the blender container about half full, and watch out for hot liquid burping around the lid.

Pour the milk and cream into a stainless-steel or enameled pot such as Le Creuset.
Stir in the salt.
Bring to a full boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar.
Allow the mixture to stand for 1 minute until it curdles.
It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey).
Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes, occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl.
The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker the ricotta.
(I tend to like mine on the thicker side, but some prefer it moister.)
Transfer the ricotta to a bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining whey.
Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
The ricotta will keep refrigerated for 4 to 5 days.

Cook time reflects the total cook time if you boil spinach and it is not already thawed.
Either thaw spinach or you can boil (also fresh may be used I use frozen in this to save on time, you don't have to wash and chop it down.)
If boiling spinach drain and rinse under cold water to cool, then take spinach in handfuls and squeeze out all excess water and place in microwave safe bowl.

Put spinach and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Simmer 5-10 minutes until spinach is tender and breaks apart easily.
Remove from heat.
Do not drain.
Use a spoon to chop spinach somewhat.
It should break up easily.
If it doesn't, cook it a little more.
Mix flour, salt, baking powder and a few sprinkles of mixed pepper in a mixing bowl.
Add olive oil and mix well, using your hands if necessary.
You don't need to over mix, just try to lightly spread the oil throughout the flour mixture.
Add the cooked spinach with water and stir to blend well.
The dough will most likely be sticky.
Add flour a little at a time until dough is soft but easy to handle, kneading it in with your hands.
It is better if the dough is still a little tacky because it will pick up flour when you roll the tortillas.
Lay the dough out on a floured board and make a tube shape.
Cut into 8 equal size pieces.
I cut the tube in half, than half each half, than half each quarter to make 8 fairly equal sized pieces.
Set aside the pieces.
Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough around in your hand to make a ball.
Place on floured board and using a rolling pin, roll it into a flat circle about 9-10 inches in diameter.
As you roll, lift edges and check periodically to make sure dough is not sticking to the board.
Add flour to the top or bottom as needed to keep dough from sticking.
Use as little flour as possible.
Too much flour worked into the dough will make it hard.
Heat a 10-inch cast iron griddle on the stove over medium heat.
If you prefer, use a paper towel dipped in olive oil and spread over pan lightly.
Do not let pan get too hot and smoke.
Lay tortilla in pan and cook each side for about 1-2 minutes.
Remove from pan and lay flat on a plate.
Repeat with each piece of dough, oiling pan as preferred between tortillas.
If pan gets too hot during cooking, remove from burner for a few minutes to cool slightly, but pan should be hot when you place the tortilla on the surface.
Do not overcook your tortillas.
If your pan is not hot enough, it takes too long to cook the tortilla and it will become tough and lose its softness.
To store, stack tortillas with a piece of waxed paper between each one and seal in plastic bag.
Freeze for two weeks or store in fridge for several days.
If frozen, let thaw completely at room temperature to avoid breaking when separating.
Reheat filled tortilla over a griddle or in the microwave.
Do not overheat in microwave as the tortilla will become tough.



Set a medium saucepan over high heat.

Safety check: yogurt cultures are a mix of bacteria developed for yogurt making.
Since you will be growing bacteria, make sure it stays the good kind by remembering food safety cleanliness rules - boil all equipment or run it through your dishwasher if you can and always make sure to keep contaminated or unwashed items from touching any of the equipment, milk or cultures you are working with at all times.
Mix the dry and liquid milk together and heat at least to 190F Hold at that temperature for 10 minutes to give the proteins a chance to do their thing.
Be careful not to ruin the batch by burning it on the bottom of the pot - you can use a double boiler if you have one.
Cool the milk mix to at least 120F but not below 100F You can reheat the milk mix if it goes below 100F.
Put part or all of the cooked milk mix in a blender - depending on the size of your blender - with the tablespoon of Siggis (make sure you taste a bit of the Siggis if you haven't tasted it yet so you know what your results should taste like - and keep any extra in your freezer for your next batch) and blend well - 10 seconds should do it.
Mix with any of the extra milk if your blender is not big enough to hold all the mixed cooked milk and Siggis.
Pour the cooled, mixed and blended milk into 8 oz cups and place in your yogurt-maker (if you have one) and start it or put the cups in a cooler with a large bottle (quart or more) of hot water - at least 140F Be sure the cups do not touch the water bottle.
If the water is too hot, it will cook the yogurt rather than allow the yogurt culture to do it's thing.
After 5 - 8 hours, check for firmness and if it is firm (will not jiggle if jostled), put in your fridge.
Taste your new yogurt after it has had time to cool down in your fridge.
(I have had yogurts firm up in as little as 3 hours and remember that the longer it continues in the yogurt maker or cooler, the more tangy your yogurt becomes.
Please note that the "cooking time" shown here is really the culture time and it can vary from a couple-3 hours to 8 or more hours, with the temperature having the greatest effect on the length of time to complete.
Too hot and it will cook - no yogurt; too cold and it will take forever/never - no yogurt.
That is why we recommend a temperature controlled yogurt-maker of your own choosing.
And the best news of all -- once you do this, you can make just about any kind of yogurt you want to - just buy either the active yogurt cultures (you can find them online) or buy a plain yogurt of the type you want with active cultures and make it according to the instructions in this recipe.
Enjoy!

In a large bowl mix the yeast with the water and allow to proof for about 10 minutes.
If the yeast doesn't start to puff up and bubble, discarded and start over with fresh yeast.
Sprinkle the flour into the yeast mixture and beat into a thick batter.
The batter doesn't have to be too smooth as the action of the yeast will break down any lumps.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm (80-85 F or 25 to 30 C) place for about 24 hours, or until it is nice and frothy.
You can use the starter right away or let it age for up to 3 days longer to develope a richer flavor.
Store starter in fridge between uses and use or replenish every two weeks.
You can use any flour or combination of flours to make the starter; some rye and buckwheat added to all-purpose makes a nice blend.
To replenish the starter: mix equal parts of water and flour (about a cup of each is good) and add to the starter at least every two weeks.
Let the starter age in a warm place for 6 to 24 hours, then use or return to the fridge.

She married an Anglican.
Knowledge is transferrable, so is skill.
Congratulation for such great effort.
No one defines formula in food.

FOR THE PASTRY: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar & salt, mixing well, then scatter butter over the dry ingredients & toss to coat the butter pieces.
Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is broken into pea-size pieces.
Add the shortening & continue to cut until all of the butter & shortening is cut into small pieces.
Sprinkle the cheese over the flour/butter mixture & cut briefly.
Sprinkle about half of the water over the flour/butter/cheese mixture, tossing well with a fork to dampen the mixture.
Add the remaining water & continue to toss & mix, pulling the mixture up from the bottom of the bowl, then pressing down again.
Add more water, if necessary, by the teaspoon to make a dough that comes together.
Using your hands, pack the pastry into 2 balls, as you would pack a snowball, making one ball slightly larger than the other~ The larger one will be for the bottom crust.
Knead each ball once or twice, then, on a floured work surface, flatten the balls into 3/4-inch-thick disks.
Wrap disks in plastic wrap & refrigerate for about 1 hour before rolling.
When the disks have chilled, on a sheet of lightly floured waxed paper & with a floured rolling pin, roll the larger portion of the pastry into a circle that is 13 1/2 inches across.
Invert the pastry over a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan, center it & then peel off the paper, before gently tucking the pastry into the pan, without stretching it.
Let the overhang drape over the edge of the pan, & refrigerate it that way.
While the pie shell is chilling .
.
.
FOR THE FILLING: In a large mixing bowl, combine the apples, sugar & lemon juice, then set aside for 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
When the apples have set for 10 minutes, stir in the walnuts if you're using them, then sprinkle 2 1/2 tablespoons of flour over the filling, using the other 1/2 tablespoon of flour ONLY if the apples are very juicy.
On another sheet of lightly floured waxed paper, roll the other half of the pastry into a circle that is 11 1/2 inches across.
Turn the filling into the refrigerated pie shell & smooth the top with your hands, then lightly moisten the rim of the pie shell.
Invert the top pastry over the filling, center it, & peel off the paper.
Press the top & bottom pastries together along the dampened edge.
Trim the pastry with scissors or a paring knife, leaving an even 1/2-inch overhang all around, then sculpt the overhang into an upstanding ridge.
With a fork or paring knife, poke several steam vents in the top of the pie, & put a couple of vents near the edge of the crust, so you can check the juices there later.
Put the pie directly on the center oven rack & bake for 25 minutes.
Remove the pie from the oven & place it on a large, dark baking sheet covered with aluminum foil.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F, then put the pie, along with the baking sheet, back in the oven & bake another 40-45 minutes or until the top is dark golden brown & any visible juices bubble thickly.
Transfer the pie to a wire rack & let cool briefly before serving.
The cheddar flavor is much better when the pie is served very warm, & it's outstanding when served with a full slice of the extra-sharp cheddar on the side!

Plump up the raisins in boiling water, drain and pat dry with paper towels.
If the raisins are coated with oil, wash it off.
Put all the ingredients except the ones marked in the bread machine, and start the dough-only program!
Since there are a lot of dried fruits, add them to the dough when the 'mix-in' signal sounds (with about 45 minutes left in the program).
When the 1st rising is done, test the dough with your finger.
The finger test: press a moistened finger into the dough and pull it out slowly.
If the hole made with the finger remains it's good!
If the hole fills back in, it has to rise some more.
Take the dough out onto a floured work surface, divide into 12 pieces (45-50 g each) and round off each piece.
Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and rest for 10 minutes.
Dust the dough lightly, turn over, deflate and round off with a smooth surface on top.
Line up on a baking sheet in pairs, each pair of rolls touching each other.
Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rise (2nd rising) at around 30C for 40 to 50 minutes (at room temperature if in the summer).
If a moistened finger gently pressed in the dough leaves a mark, it's done rising.
Mist with water, (optionally dust with bread flour) and preheat the oven to 200C.
Lower the temperature to 180C and bake for 10 to 12 minutes - done!
They look like this inside.
I used this "Super Fine Hard" whole wheat flour.
This version has 50% whole wheat flour (140 g finely ground) + 140 g bread flour.
This really has the flavor of whole wheat, and the more you chew the better it tastes.
This version has 64% whole wheat flour (160g superfine whole wheat + 20 g graham flour) + 100 g domestic bread flour.
This version is very light!
For the version in Step 11: Try baking six rolls stuck together, or slashing the tops.
If you use domestic bread flour, use 170 ml of water.
This version has 82% whole wheat flour (210 g superfine whole wheat flour + 20 g graham flour) + 50 g bread flour 30 g each of walnuts and raisins = densely textured and delicious.

Scrape down sides of food processor container (the fumes are very strong, so keep your face away from the bowl and the room well ventilated).
Continue blending, adding a bit more water if mixture seems too dry.
Process until horseradish is finely ground.
Wait 2 minutes before adding the vinegar and salt; supposedly this makes the horseradish hotter.
After 2 or 3 minutes, add vinegar and salt.

Melt the butter and honey together, and mix them into the cool, cooked oatmeal.
Mix in the milk, half at a time.
Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.
You may wish to adjust the salt depending on how much was used in cooking the oatmeal- I am assuming not very much, if any.
Mix the flour into the oatmeal.
If the mixture seems too moist, add a little more flour.
(This will depend on how moist your cooked oatmeal was.
When enough flour has been stirred in, the dough will form a rough ball.)

After an hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator and separate it into pieces the size of golf balls.
If the dough sticks to your hands, dip them in flour.
Roll out balls between your hands into snake-like shapes, about the length and thickness of yourpinky.
Separate each ball into 4 smaller sections and roll each section into a snake.
Place snakes 1-inch apart on cookie sheets.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the snakes begin to turn light brown.
Carefully remove the cookie sheets from the oven and immediately remove the snakes from the sheets to a platter.

Preheat the oven to 325F
Toast each type of nut separately by placing them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and baking until a little more than golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes for the cashews, 15 minutes for the pistachios, and 5 to 10 minutes for the almonds.
As they are finished, let them cool to room temperature.
Then gather them in a bowl and stir them together.
Put 2 cups of the sugar in a saute pan and set it over medium-high heat.
Let the sugar melt and caramelize until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes.
Then add 4 tablespoons of the butter and whisk it with the sugar until it takes on an almost saucelike consistency.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 2 cups of the nuts and stir until they are well coated in the caramel.
Pour the mixture out onto a foil-lined baking sheet, spreading it out with a baking spatula.
Repeat with the remaining sugar, butter, and nuts.
Put the baking sheets in the oven and bake until the nuts spread out into a flat sheet, approximately 10 minutes.

Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water.
Boil only 3 or possibly 4 at a time so they do not crowd.
Simmer each side for a minute and return to the baking sheet.
Add in glazes or possibly toppings as desired.
Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven.
The book calls for 20 to 25 min.
I usually start at 15 min for the 1st sheet and less for the second.
These are best eaten while they are still hot.
They can be frzn - you may want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster.
Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dry peaches for the apricots
NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract.
These are really excellent.

For those who are just getting started in how to cook with quinoa-- quinoa naturally comes with a bitter exterior called saponin.
You NEED to properly rinse it before cooking with it!
Don't give me a low score for bitter taste because you have to rinse it well first!
Put the quinoa in a deep bowl and pour cold water over it.
With a fork or whisk, stir it heavily for a couple minutes until a soapy residue is floating to the top.
Strain it through a fine-mesh colander and rinse it under the tap again.
Now your quinoa's ready for cooking!
Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and add a little salt so the quinoa doesn't stick to the bottom.
Add the olive oil and cardamom to the boiled water and let it impart for a few seconds.
Add the rinsed quinoa and lower the heat to medium.
Loosely cover the pot and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all the quinoa pieces have fluffed out.

Sprinkle the last 1/2 cup of flour onto your kneading surface.
Turn out the dough and knead until it begins to feel as if it really belongs together, adding only enough flour to keep it from sticking to the board or you.
Let it rest while you clean and grease your bowl.
Continue kneading the relaxed dough until it feels smooth and springy.
(I usually knead the relaxed dough for a full five minutes.)
Form the dough into a nice ball, place it in the greased bowl, turning it so the top is lightly greased also.

Turn your smoker on the medium setting and allow it to warm up for 10 minutes.
Turn it down to the smoke setting and keep it there for 5 minutes before putting the chicken on.
In a small bowl, add all of the spices and mix to combine.
Sprinkle the spice rub evenly over the whole chicken and use your hands to lightly press the spices into the chicken.
Note: If you have the time, you can refrigerate your rubbed chicken for up to 24 hours.
(Ours was rubbed up and marinated in the refrigerator for 2 hours before smoking).
If you enjoy drizzling oil over your meat before you add a dry rub, feel free.
I only add oil when I think it is absolutely necessary and in most cases, I dont think its necessary.
The key is to cook the meat to the proper temperature, which is around 165 F for poultry.
Place chicken on the smoker either breast-side down or breast-side up on the smoker.
Close the lid and allow chicken to smoke for 3 to 3.5 hours, depending on the temperature of your smoker.
Checking the temperature of the meat with a thermometer, the chicken should be about 165 F on the inside when done.
If it needs more time after 3 hours, you can put your smoker on the high setting in order to finish cooking and give the skin a nice crisp, careful not to over-cook.
Allow chicken to cool before serving it with your favorite side dishes.

Peel the ginger using a sharp-edged teaspoon (or a small knife) -- yep that is the easiest way, just scrape it toward you and all comes off.
In the joints just break apart the pieces to get all the peeling.
Now slice it in 1/4-inch-thick slices -- I used the Cuisinart since I was doing so much but you can use a mandoline or sharp knife.
Place the slices in a large nonreactive saucepan with cold water to cover, bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes.
Drain, cover with fresh cold water, boil, and again cook 15 minutes.
Repeat this blanching process 2 more times, for a total of 4 blanchings in all.
After the last blanching, drain and cover with 6 cups of fresh cold water and 3 cups of sugar.
Slowly bring the syrup to a boil, stirring often, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the ginger is translucent and the syrup is thickened, about 20-30 minutes; watch carefully.
Remove from heat.
You now have Canton candied ginger and can store it this way (in it's syrup, in a sterilized jar with a tight fitting lid, and refrigerated) for practically forever.
Or, for crystallized ginger, let stand for about 30 minutes, for the ginger to absorb more syrup.
Then you can take the pieces of ginger from the syrup and toss it in granulated sugar and put it on a rack (or on a parchment lined baking sheet) to dry, uncovered at room temperature, for at least 8 hours or overnight, until the sugar coating is firm and the slices are no longer sticky.
This also keeps for at least a year, stored in a cool dry place in an airtight container.
Notes: Save the syrup for flavoring, it has a strong ginger flavor and can be used to flavor drinks-- it is so yummy!
I also save the sugar that I tossed it in to use in recipes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a cookie sheet with the almond oil.
Place the almonds on a separate baking sheet and toast them until light golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Set aside.
In a medium, very heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook over medium-high heat until the sugar liquefies, then turns light golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
It should register 238 degrees F on a candy thermometer; this is referred to as the soft ball stage.
Do not stir, but brush the sugar crystals off the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush as necessary.
Once the sugar begins to brown, watch carefully and remove from heat as soon as it is the desired color, as the sugar can burn quickly.
Once the caramel is off the heat, immediately add the almonds to the pot and stir quickly to incorporate.
Turn out onto the oiled cookie sheet, spreading quickly to an even thickness.
Allow the brittle to cool completely, then break into festive shapes.

Pour dry oatmeal into bowl and add 1/2 cup of soy milk and let sit 10 minutes.
Mix with remaining ingredients till well blended, but do not overmix.
More milk may be needed depending on desired consistency.
Drop 3 tablespoons of mixture onto a nonstick skillet at medium high heat and cook for 1 minute each side.
Serve hot.



Heat oven to 450 degrees.
Measure and sift (important!)
dry ingredients into bowl.
Pour oil and milk into measuring cup- do not stir together; pour all at once into flour mixture.
Stir until mixture cleans side of bowl and forms a ball.
If dough is too sticky, add some flour.
If it's not sticking together enough, add a bit more milk.
To knead dough, turn onto a sheet of wax paper (or plastic wrap--I use plastic wrap because it's much cheaper and I don't always have wax paper) that's big enough so that you can fold the paper (or plastic) over on to the ball of dough and press it flat.
Fold the dough over on itself several times or until it looks smooth.
This is kind of like kneading bread dough.
Pat or roll the dough until it's 1/2 inch thick.
Cut dough with unfloured biscuit cutter (or just a regular knife--square biscuits are just as delicious as round ones!).
Ensure that each of the biscuit has been cut around its entire perimeter; the cut edges have the best texture!
I usually make a dough rectangle and then cut it into squares with a sharp non-serrated knife, taking care to cut off the outer 1/4 inch so that all of the biscuits have four nice cut edges.
Place on ungreased, single-layer baking sheet.
Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
Be sure to check to see if the bottoms have browned before removing from oven!



Preheat the oven to 225 F.
Combine the above ingredients in a bowl and mix very well.
Spread out the mixed ingredients on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
Put the baking sheet into the oven and let the mixture heat for 60 minutes.
Cooking times will vary (the zest should crumple when rolled between your fingers).
Remove the salt from the oven.
Let it cool slightly.
Take the parchment paper and gather it at the top, so that the ingredients sit at the bottom and cannot spill from the parchment.
With your fingers press the salt (it may have clumps) while it remains in the parchment.
Pour the salt contents into a bowl and further stir and press with a spoon to make the contents fine (so that it easily pours through a salt shaker).
Place the finished salt in a shaker and enjoy on your food whether its cooking or finished.
It does add a nice touch.
Enjoy!

In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter.
Once melted, add sugar, corn syrup, and salt.
You want it to cook very slowly, not boiling quickly because you do not want sugar crystals to form.
Medium heat is best.
You can stir it occasionally, but do not scrape around the sides of the pan.
This could cause crystals to form.
The slower the boil, the smoother the candy.
Continue to cook until candy thermometer reads 295 degrees F.
Meanwhile, pour slivered almonds onto the greased cookie sheet.
Once almonds are spread out, pour cooked candy over top.
Let sit until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour.
Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.



Mix above in crock or possibly bowl (not stainless steel) cover with kitchen towel or possibly cheescloth, let stand overnight.

Preheat the oven to 500F.
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Using a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
Pour in the buttermilk, and gently mix until just combined.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
Knead lightly, using the heel of your hand to compress and push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself.
Give the dough a small turn and repeat 8 or so times.
(Its not yeast bread; you want to just barely activate the gluten, not overwork it.)
Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out 1/2 inch thick.
Cut out rounds of dough with a 2 1/4-inch round cutter dipped in flour; press the cutter straight down without twisting so the biscuits will rise evenly when baked.
Place the biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet or in an 8- by 2-inch round cake pan.
If the biscuits are baked close together the sides will be moist.
If the biscuits are baked further apart, the sides will be crisp.
Bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
Transfer to a rack to cool just slightly.
Serve warm.
If I dont feel like rolling out biscuits, or just want a different texture, I tweak the recipe by adding more buttermilk to the dough and make drop biscuits: use 3 cups of flour2 for the dough and 1 cup placed in a bowl to shape the dough into biscuits.
Increase the buttermilk to 2 cups.
The dough will be very wet and resemble cottage cheese.
To form the biscuits into balls, scoop up some dough with a large ice cream scoop; place the dough balls in the bowl with the 1 cup of flour.
Working one at a time, roll the balls to coat in flour, then set in an ungreased 8- by 2-inch round cake pan.
The baking time will be the same as for cut biscuits.

Mix all dry ingredients together.
Mix well.
Add oil and water.
Mix until flour is well incorporated.
Knead 8 or 10 times.
Dough should only be slightly sticky.
If necessary, add a few more tablespoons flour.
Let rest 15-20 minutes so dough can relax.
If I have time I let the dough rise for 1-2 hours, then punch down and form into pizza crusts.
This helps develop a better flavor, but the dough is still very good if it is used after the short rest period.
Use a small portion of dough - appropriate for the size of pan you are using to bake the pizza.
(One third of the dough if using 8 inch pans) Place dough on a counter, table, or breadboard.
Gently press on it, using the tips or your fingers or the palms of your hand, to flatten and stretch the dough.
Let dough rest for 2-5 minutes when the dough doesn't seem to want to stretch anymore.
This will allow it to rest and relax, and then it will stretch again.
Continue pressing the dough out until it is the size needed for the pizza pan.
I do not use a rolling pin as this alters the texture of the dough.
Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on your pizza pan.
Spread oil evenly.
Sprinkle each pan with one tsp cornmeal.
Place stretched-out dough in pan.
(I use a cast iron skillet and our pizza turns out like Pizza Hut pan pizza.
).
Top with sauce, toppings, and cheese.
Let pizza set for about 15 minutes to allow dough to rise.
Bake at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until dough is golden and cheese is starting to brown.
Baking time varies depending on the type and size of pan you are using.

Put about one teaspoon filling onto each square.
Roll diagonally, then crimp in the middle to make a crescent.
Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes or until golden.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar as soon as removed from oven.
All of the recipes I searched agreed that letting the dough rest overnight is key to getting it nice and flaky.
Enjoy!



Pour about 1/2 cup of the milk into a small bowl, and the rest into a medium saucepan.
Whisk the cornstarch with the milk in the bowl until smooth, and then add it to the milk in the saucepan.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake the bread for one hour.
As there a re so many apples in it, the wooden toothpick trick will not work, the bread is way too moist.
So you have to watch and eyeball a bit after one hour whether it really is done or not.
I've never baked it longer than one hour, though, and it always turned out done.
Remove pan from oven and cut around the rim of the pan to prevent bread from sticking.
Let cool in the pan, then carefully remove it.
If using non stick baking paper to line the pan, you can also carefully lift the bread out of the pan immediately and eat it warm, which is delicious with some vanilla ice cream :).

Just make sure the salt and wet stuff stays away from the yeast until it mixes.
If you like the old fashioned way, that will work too - just use your usual process.
For rolls, use the dough cycle.
When that cycle is done, dump it out on a floured surface and cut everything into even quarters, twice.
Put the wads, evenly spaced, on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.
Let them rise once more in a warm area covered with waxed paper for a half hour or a little longer until they have roughly doubled in size, depending on how knocked down they got while cutting.
Cook in an oven, preheated to 375 degrees, for 20 minutes or until they are nicely browned top and bottom.

(I used a blender to pulse the dry, and then mixed in the oil and syrup by hand in a bowl so it wouldn't get stuck in the bottom of the blender).
Press the mixture into a prepared pie plate.
I like to use the bottom of a glass to press the crust down evenly on the bottom and sides.
Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.
Fill with your favorite pie filling: mine is PUMPKIN.



Beat all ingredients together with an electric mixer in a medium sized bowl.
Chill at least an hour, preferably overnight if you can wait that long to dive into it.

Throw everything in the crockpot the night before (see note below regarding prep for the crock, which you would need to do before adding ingredients), and whisk, whisk, whisk!
As for the milk, I used skim milk, but you use whatever kind you drink (you can also use soy, almond or rice milk).
I love cinnamon, so I threw in a dash.
You can omit it entirely or add a little more.
Do whatever floats your boat.
Cook on low for 5 9 hours.
The cooking time depends on your crockpot and how you like your oatmeal.
I prefer mine thicker so that I can thin it to the best texture.
After cooking, give the oatmeal a good strong stir to make sure everything is nicely incorporated.
The oatmeal will be very thick; I thinned mine with a little milk.
Now, add your toppings!
Whatever toppings your heart may desire!
Nuts, dried fruit, butter, sugar, honey, molasses or maple syrup!
This recipe freezes very well (I had a bowl of my previously frozen oatmeal this morning).
Just divy it up into small containers, cool it in the refrigerator, then toss them in the freezer for another morning.
This recipe is sure to please any oatmeal fan.
Im currently playing with the recipe to make all sorts of flavors (my current favorite is banana nut.
I will post that one later).
* NOTE: use whatever method you wish to make your crockpot non-stick (maybe you already have a non-stick one.
Use liners, non-stick spray, whatevs.
I did not use anything and it did stick.
I simply let it soak with soapy water until I could scrub it clean, but some people may not have the affinity for washing dishes that I have.



Combine the flour, salt, and shortening in a large bowl and mix together until crumbly, as for pie dough.
Add water and mix until you can gather the dough into a ball.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
To form the tortillas, divide the dough into 12 equal portions.
Roll each portion between the palms of your hands to make a ball.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into an 8 inch circle.
Layer the circles between sheets of plastic wrap as you go.
To cook the tortillas, heat a heavy skillet, griddle or comal over high heat until beginning to smoke.
Place a tortilla in the pan and cook for 30 seconds.
Turn and cook on the other side until slightly puffed and speckled brown on the underside but still soft enough to fold, about 30 seconds.
Remove and continue until all the tortillas are cooked, stacking them as you go.
Serve right away or cool, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.



Blend with a mixer on high for about a minute -- it should be creamy and thick in appearance.
Refrigerate for an hour or so before using.

When they start to bubble but are still pale it means they are getting close to being done.
Pull them out when they are golden brown and immediately place them inside a bowl to shape.
Sometimes a bowl of cold water is nice to stick your fingers in if they get burnt.
You can make smaller circles and roll them up like a cannoli.
They are great dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with toasted almonds and or toasted coconut.
You can also fill them with whipped cream!
**If you want add other flavors like almond extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, vanilla extract or what ever you heart desires, it adds a nice twist to the honey flavor!

The is important for the flavor!
Once the butter has browned, add the onions and saute until tender.
Check the rice to make sure the broth has all been absorbed; if not, continue cooking until it has been, probably no more than an additional 5 minutes.
Once the rice is cooked and the broth is absorbed, pour the brown butter with onions over the top and stir to coat.
