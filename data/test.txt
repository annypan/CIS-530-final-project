Lay the 3 ropes along the upper edge of the pie pan, pressing lightly into the dough already in the pan.
Flute the edge as you would a rolled crust.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
(Dough can be held up to 2 days in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer if double wrapped.
).
Prick the bottom of the dough all over with a fork (try not to go all the way through to the pan, or the filling might leak).
Bake in preheated 325F oven for about 35 minutes until golden brown.



Combine flour& salt in a bowl.
With your fingers or a pastry blender, cut in butter& shortening until mixture resembles bread crumbs.
Combine wter& vinegar and sprinkle over flour mixture a little bit at a time, tossing together with a fork, until the pastry is moist enough to hold its shape when a little piece is pressed between your fingers.

Place a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet.
Arrange okra on rack and bake until crisp, about 10 minutes.



Stir together the flour and salt with a fork to blend.
Cut the fat into the flour using a food processor, pastry blender, or 2 knives.
(For pies with liquid fillings like custard or cooked fruit fillings that are thickened with cornstarch or tapioca, the bits of fat should be evenly small, and the mixture should resemble a coarse meal.
This will result in a mealy pie crust, which is less likely to become soggy as the pie bakes.
For pies to be filled with fruit or another nonliquid filling, leave some bits of fat in larger pieces, about the size of a small pea, for a crisp and flaky texture in the baked crust.)
Drizzle a few tablespoons of the ice water over the surface of the flour mixture and quickly rub the water into the flour.
Continue to add the water, a tablespoon or so at a time, just until it holds together when you press a handful of it into a ball.
The dough should be evenly moist, not wet, and shaggy or rough in appearance.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface.
Gather and press the dough into a ball, wrap well, and let chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Unwrap the dough, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and scatter a little flour over the top.
Alternatively, place the dough between sheets of parchment or waxed paper.
Roll out the dough for the bottom crust of a pie into an even round about 13 inches in diameter (for a 9-inch pie pan).
It should be about 1/8 inch thick.
Fold the dough in half or roll it loosely around the rolling pin, and gently lift and position it over the pan.
Unfold or unroll and ease the dough into the pan without stretching, making sure that the pan sides and the rim are evenly covered.
Press the dough gently against the sides and bottom.
Trim the overhang to 1 inch.
Tuck the dough overhang under itself and flute the edges.
Fill and bake the pie according to recipe directions.
Pie doughs may be soft and difficult to roll either because they are too warm, a little too much water has been added to the dough, or the weather is humid.
Using marble pastry boards and rolling pins, which stay cooler than the surrounding air, helps to keep pastry dough cool and easy to handle.
Another trick to working with pie dough is to roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment or waxed paper.
This technique can be a big help to the novice baker.

Gather the dough together so that it forms a ball.
Do not over-handle the dough as you will end up with a tough pastry.
Divide pastry in half, and roll between two strips of waxed paper.
(If you moisten your surface with a damp cloth, the waxed paper will not slip around.
).
Roll in a circle about 12 inches in diameter.
Peel the top sheet of waxed paper off the pastry, gently fit the crust in a 9-inch pie pan (crust down), and gently peel off the paper.
If you like, you can trim the crust leaving about 1/2 inch overhanging.
Heap your apple filling into the pastry-lined pan.
(If you are using frozen filling, you may want to add 1 tablespoons cornstarch just in case the filling is too juicy -- no one likes a soggy pie!
).
Roll top crust the same way as the bottom crust and place over the filling, trimming about 1/2 inch beyond the pan rim.
Fold the crust under and flute or use whatever decorative edging you like.
The easiest way is to just take the tines of a fork and seal the two crusts together, working around the pie pan and then trim the excess.
Cut some slits in the top crust to let steam escape.
Cover the edges of the crust with a strip of aluminum foil to prevent over-browning of the edges.
Set the pie on a pizza tin or a pan to collect any juices that might overflow.
Bake 50 minutes, then remove the strips of aluminum foil and bake 10 more minutes.

Helpful Hints
You can make your own blanched almond flour for this recipe by grinding slivered almonds in a food processor or blender until it becomes a finely ground flour.
If you prefer, you can grind the sesame seeds in a coffee grinder (maybe a blender or food processor).
Just remember that the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons before grinding.
Many cheese recipes call for nutritional yeast.
I personally do not like nutritional yeast so did not include it in this recipe, but if you like nutritional yeast feel free to add some.



In a food processor combine 2 3/4 cups of the flour (reserve the remaining flour for rolling out the dough) with the lard or shortening.
Pulse several times until the fat is evenly distributed throughout the flour and no particles of fat are visible.
Dissolve the salt in 23 cup of the warm water.
With the machine running, pour the liquid through the feed tube in a steady stream and stop the machine once the dough has come together in a ball.
Feel the dough, it should be a medium-stiff consistency, not too firm but not as soft as most bread doughs.
If the dough is too stiff, divide it into several pieces, sprinkle with 1 or 2 tablespoons of the remaining water and process again until a ball forms.
Divide the dough into 12 portions, roll into balls and place on a flat surface or plate.
Cover with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface roll each ball into a 7-inch circle by flattening the ball of dough, lightly flouring it, and with a rolling pin rolling forward and backward over the dough, then turn it a sixth of a turn and roll forward and backward again.
Repeat the turning and rolling process until a 7-inch circle is formed, re-flouring the work surface as necessary.
Place the tortilla on a plate and cover with plastic wrap.
Repeat the rolling out process for the remaining 11 balls of dough.
Heat a flat cast iron griddle over moderately high heat.
Lay a tortilla on the griddle and cook for 20 to 45 seconds until tortilla bubbles and lightly browns on the underside.
Flip the tortilla and cook it for another 30 to 45 seconds.
The tortilla should be lightly browned but still soft and flexible.
Transfer the cooked tortilla to a heavy towel and wrap it up.
Cook the remaining tortillas in a similar manner and store stacked in the towel to keep them warm and soft.
The tortillas can be stored in a sealable plastic bag and refrigerated until ready for use.
To reheat the tortillas, tuck them in an envelope made out of aluminum foil and heat in a 325F (160C).

Special equipment: 3 inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, and a smaller cookie cutter that will fit inside the round one for a peek-a-boo of jam that peeks through the top cookie.
1.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 2.
Put the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl and combine it on medium low speed.
Beat it until it looks creamy and has lightened a bit in color.
3.
Then add the vanilla extract and stir to fully incorporate.
Set aside.
4.
Whisk salt into the flour in a separate bowl.
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 2-3 batches, stirring in between each addition.
Stir until well combined and the dough starts to come together.
The dough will be very crumbly.
5.
Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on a clean, flat surface.
Dump the crumbly dough onto the plastic wrap.
6.
Fold the plastic wrap over the crumblies, and push them together.
The heat of your hands will soften the butter a bit, and it will eventually come together as a mass of dough.
Try to shape it into as close to a rectangle as possible.
Pop it in to the fridge for 20 minutes or so, or until firm.
7.
Unwrap the chilled dough, and roll it out evenly on a floured surface until its rolled into 1/8-inch thickness.
8.
Once the dough has been rolled rather thinly, cut the dough with a 3 inch cookie or biscuit cutter.
I used a circle, but you can use whatever shape you like.
Then take the smaller cutter, and make cut-outs in half of the circles (I used a star cutout).
Remember that these are sandwich cookies, so each one will need a solid bottom, and a top with a shape cut out.
9.
Put the dough pieces on a parchment lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-22 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly browned.
10.
Feel free to roll the cute little centers back into the dough to make additional larger cookies.
Or just bake them as they are, which is what I did.
They only took about 9 or 10 minutes.
11.
Remove cookies from oven and cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before moving them to a cooling rack to cool completely.
12.
Before serving, spread about 1/2 teaspoon of jam in a thin layer onto all of the the solid cookies.
13.
Then top each with a matching cut-out cookie topper.
Repeat this until all of the cookies are sandwiches.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Wash and pit plums.
Leave skin on.
Crush plums in food processor, chopper, or blender.
There may be some foam.
It's okay to have some fruit chunks.
Stir the plums and sugar together in a deep, large pot and slowly (to reduce foaming) bring it to a boil at 220 degrees and boil for 15 -20 minutes.
Skim off foam.
While the plums are boiling, disinfect the canning jars and lids in boiling water.
This will also help to soften the gel rim of the lids.
Fill the jars to 1/4 inch from the top and seal tightly.
Give the jars a 10-15 minute water bath in boiling water.
Remove from the water and allow to cool overnight in a draft-free area.
Jars should not be touching.
You will hear the lids pop as they cool and seal.
Test the seal in the morning.
You should not be able to "pop" it up and down.
If any jars do not seal, store in the fridge and use those first!
(You can use a new lid and give it another water bath too.
).
Sealed jars should be good for 6 months to a year.

Spread the Sriracha salt out thinly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Put the baking sheet in the oven and turn off the heat immediately.
Allow the salt to sit in the residual heat until completely dry.
The drying time can vary greatly depending on many factors, but it usually ranges from 2 to 3 hours.
Okay, so it may not be done in a pinch per se, but it does cut the drying time down from days to hours.



Melt butter and cocoa butter on low temperature.
Place all dry ingredients into a mug or mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly
Mix all wet ingredients in a separate mixing bowl.
Slowly add dry ingredients to wet, whisking throughout.

Starter - mix the yeast with one glass of warm water and wait until rises or use sourdough starter.
In a large container mix Rice and Sorghum flour with water; or beat it lightly in a blender;
Add the starter and mix it well.
Add water generously and cover it tight.
Keep it outside to ferment (the dough needs only 14-16 hours to ferment).
The second day pour the fermented water in container and set aside.
Blend the self-raising with four cups of the fermented water and mix it with the dough.
This time it should be thinner than pancake dough; keep it outside to rise for 30 minutes.
Warm a flat pancake pan, or skillet, or a specialized electric stove and pour the dough in circle shape, each Injera bakes within 20 second even less.
P.S.
Rice and sorghum dough ferment faster than Teff .
Therefore, if not baked within a day, keep the dough in the fridge.

Put the milk into a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and yeast and whisk to dissolve.
Let the yeast mixture sit for a few minutes until foamy.
Mix together the flour, whole wheat flour, and salt.
Add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture and stir until a sticky dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a liberally floured surface and knead for a few strokes, just long enough to form a smooth dough.
Add flour as needed.
Roll the dough out with a floured rolling pin into a rectangle, about 9 x 14 inches.
Put the margarine between two sheets of wax paper and roll out into a 6 x 8 rectangle.
Peel off the wax paper and place the margarine on the bottom half of the dough.
Fold the bottom, sides, and top half over the margarine, encasing it completely.
Sprinkle the dough with flour, cover with plastic or place in a plastic bag, and refrigerate for 45 minutes.
First turn: place the dough on a liberally floured work surface and roll out with a floured rolling pin using firm, smooth strokes.
Roll out to 9 x 14, then fold the bottom and top halves in towards the center (like folding up a letter).
Sprinkle with flour, cover with plastic again, and refrigerate for 45 minutes.
Second turn: repeat as above, refrigerating for 45 minutes.
Third turn: repeat as above, refrigerating for 45 minutes.
Shape the croissants: Line a baking sheet with parchment and spray with nonstick spray and set aside.
Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface to about 10 x 20.
Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut into eight squares.
Cut each square in half diagonally to form 16 triangles.
Pull the top triangle point out a little to lengthen, then start at the bottom of the triangle and roll it up tightly.
Tuck the tip under and curve the edges in a bit to form a croissant shape (I give each one a little squish at the end to help hold the shape).
Repeat with the remaining croissants, placing them on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Spray the croissants with nonstick spray, cover lightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours, until light and puffy.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees .
Bake the croissants for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until golden brown.
Cool on a wire rack.



Mix 2 1/2 cups of the flour in a bowl with the baking soda, baking powder, and the salt.
Mix the maple syrup, applesauce, brown sugar, and soymilk in another bowl, Stir the flour mixture into the mixed wet ingredients.
Continue to add flour 1/4 cup at a time until dough is no longer sticky.
Knead dough by hand adding a couple of tablespoons of flour at a time if dough becomes sticky.
Dough can now be rolled and shaped as per need.
Typical baking time is 10 minutes in a 325F oven.
This recipe is the best effort to date of trying to find a workable low fat alternative to high fat pastry type cookie dough.
Corn syrup will work in place of the maple syrup.
Increasing the baking soda lightens the cookie, while decreasing it produces a chewier cookie.
Sugar can be adjusted up or down as desired.



Add pumpkin spice and brown sugar to prepared hot chocolate.
Top off with whipped cream and ground cinnamon.



Heat large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat.

Transfer rice to pan and spread evenly; smoothing the top with the back of a spoon.
Set aside.
Combine flour and 4 tablespoons water in a small cup and stir to make a slurry and set aside.
Combine brown sugar, butter, evaporated milk, and milk in a non-stick saucepan over medium heat.
Cook, stirring constantly until mixture comes to a boil.
Stir in flour mixture and whisk until sauce has thickened and is smooth.
Spread over rice evenly.
Brown top under broiler for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.
Do not burn.
Let cool at room temperature until firm and cut into pieces with a plastic knife.
I decrease the sugars by 1/2 cup and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp as I do not like very sweet desserts.
Sweet rice is available in Asian markets.
The short grain sweet rice is normally used.
Long-grained glutinous rice is used by Thai's for sweet sticky rice.
Coconut milk can be purchased canned or frozen.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
Add dry ingredients to a large bowl.
Add the butter and using a fork or butter knife cut it in a bit to make the butter into bits the size of sugar cubes.
This seems to help the butter distribute better once the oil is added.
Then add the oil.
With your hand (or hands) rub the butter and oil into the flour/sugar.
When you're done there will be no dry flour remaining and you'll be able to form a ball.
Press the pastry into a pie plate or tart forms.
Prick the bottom with a fork to prevent the crust from forming bubbles and place in a 350 degree fahrenheit oven.
Cooking times will vary, but expect 15 to 20 minutes for a light crust.
Note: This has only been used for Lemon Tarts and Cook & Serve Pudding fillings.
I have not used it for longer cooking fillings and don't know how it would fare for things like Pumpkin Pie, etc.



Line an 8-inch round baking pan with foil.
Mix together cookie crumbs and melted butter until evenly combined.
Press into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Prepare chocolate sauce by placing the icing sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, butter and evaporated milk in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil over medium heat.
Simmer for 7 minutes, until slightly thickened (it will thicken more as it cools).
Cool completely, whisking occasionally to prevent a skin from forming.
To prepare the cake, top the cookie crumbs in the pan with half of the ice cream, peanuts and chocolate sauce.
Repeat layers.
Freezing in between if necessary.
Once fully assembled, freeze until solid (about 2 hours).
To serve: loosen foil from sides of pan (warming up with hands if necessary) and lift out.
Peel away foil; slice and serve.



Preheat your oven to 375F and grease twelve muffin tins.
Mix together the first five dry ingredients in a large bowl.
Gently stir in the soymilk, oil, and vanilla but be careful not to over mix.
Fold in strawberries and pour the batter into your prepared muffin tins, 3/4 of the way to the top.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean; let muffins sit for 10 minutes or more before removing them from the pan.



Put dry rice into a bowl and fill with tap water.
Let soak for an hour
Then, rinse rice and discard the soaking water
In a pot, heat oil over high heat and add rice.
Fry for a minute
Then add 2 cups of water.
Bring to a boil (covered partially with a lid)
Then add salt, cover and cook until rice is soft (it should take up to 45 minutes but mine took only 28) and all liquid is absorbed.
If liquid is absorbed but rice isn't cooked, feel free to add more water
Take off heat but keep covered for 10 minutes
I serve my rice with this :) Enjoy!



Take a 1.5-liter plastic bottle of spring water and empty it into a clean pitcher.
Use some of it to make simple syrup by stirring 1/2 pound sugar into 1 cup hot water until fully dissolved.
In a large measuring cup, mix all ingredients and stir well.
Funnel back into the plastic bottle and cap tightly.
Store in a warm, dark place for 24 to 48 hours.
(I put mine inside a box, to contain it if it should blow.)
The top of the bottle will expand and become tight.
Check it and very slowly release the pressure if its looking groaningly tight.
Some people ferment it with no top, or with the top on loosely, to allow gas to escape.
I suppose if you wanted to get fancy you could spend $1.50 on a fermentation lock and stop worrying about it.
If the temperature is quite warm, above 80F, a single day may be sufficient.
The longer you let it ferment, the drier the final mix will be.
After 48 hours, refrigerate it to stop the fermentation.
Once chilled, you can strain out the pulp and dead yeast, which will have made a sediment on the bottom.
Makes 1 liter and will keep up to a week in the refrigerator.



Place potatoes and milk in 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.
Sprinkle cheese over potatoes.
Cover dish.
Cook in microwave 8 to 10 minutes or until potatoes cook and are almost done, stirring every few minutes.
Stir in broccoli and shrimp and cook about 5 minutes more or until broccoli is tender.



Stir together the dry ingredients.
Stir together the wet ingredients.
Combine the two, stirring just to blend.
Divide the mixture in half; it will make 2 single crusts or one crust plus a streusel topping.
Press half of the dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9" pie pan, crimping the edges.
Use the other half to make the bottom crust for another pie or put it back in the mixing bowl, add 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.
Mix till it becomes moist/crumbly.
Fill your prepared crust, spread the topping over the filling, and bake as directed.



Make this a day ahead so that the wings can marinate for 24 hours.
Combine the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, ketchup and garlic in a bowl and mix well.
Add the chicken wings and toss lghtly to coat.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate stirring occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Line a cookie sheet with foil and arrange the wings skin side down.
Bake for 25 minutes, turn the wings over and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until golden brown.



Combine brown sugar, butter and cream in bowl, mix well.
Add coconut, nuts, and rice krispies.mix well.
Spread topping over warm cake.

Remove from heat.
Add in cereal; toss to coat well.
Press into pan.
Cold.
Cut into 2x2 inch squares.



Combine water, fresh lemon juice, sugar, and honey in a large pitcher.
Stir until all ingredients are dissolved.
Taste for balance.
Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.
Chef's Note: For whisky spiked lemonade, use approximately 1.5 to 3 ounces whisky (recommended: Southern Comfort) for every 8 ounces of lemonade.



You start by putting the 1/2 gallon of milk in a 2 3 quart crock pot.
Put lid on and cook on low for 2 1/2 hours.
Turn off and let sit (with lid on) for 3 hours.
After 3 hours add the live yogurt.
This can be from a previous batch or bought at the store (on the label of the container it will say live cultures).
Mix it well, until completely incorporated.
If you like your yogurt thicker, at this point you can add the dry milk powder.
Just make sure you incorporate it well.
This is also the point where you add the sugar or honey and the vanilla extract.
If you dont want to do flavored or sweetened yogurt, just leave it out.
This is THE most important part of making homemade yogurt.
Wrap the crock pot (I use a bath towel and clothes pins to cover it completely if you have a thermal travel bag, that would work too) and let it sit overnight, at least 8 hours.
In the morning you will have your very own homemade organic yogurt.
Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container and stored in the fridge.
Also, if you want to add fruits or granola, stir it in just before serving NOT when you add the sweetener and vanilla extract.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the butter, honey and maple syrup.
Stir until combined.
Add the pancake mix and stir until fully incorporated.
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Use a medium cookie scoop (or a tablespoon) to drop the dough (it will be pretty thin) onto the prepared trays.
Leave about 2 inches of space between cookies.
Bake at 350 degrees F for about 15 minutes, until golden brown.
Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool for a couple of minutes on the tray, then cool completely on a wire rack.
(Recipe adapted from Little Bitty Bakes.)



Preheat oven to 350F.
Place zucchini in shallow baking dish sprayed with cooking spray.

DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead.
Cool slightly; cover and chill.
Rewarm over medium-low heat before using, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F.
Place grapes on rimmed baking sheet.
Drizzle with oil; toss.
Roast grapes until beginning to wrinkle, about 15 minutes.
Transfer to bowl; toss with vinegar.
DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead.
Let stand at room temperature.
Add grapes and any juices, walnuts, and orange peel to hot rice; toss well.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.



Melt butter in a sauce pan or skillet.
Add corn, cooking for 6 mins.
over medium high heat.
Stirring, every so often.....after it starts bubbling.
I used frozen corn.
Stir in sour cream and cook another 3 mins, or until heated, through.
I used sour cream with chives, as it was what I had on hand.
Remove from heat and add cheese and basil.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together (oats through salt).
In a small bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, maple syrup and vanilla.
Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until everything is well incorporated.
Add the almond milk to the mixture and stir well.
You will end up with a crumbly dough.
Scoop out tablespoon-sized scoops of the mixture and transfer to the baking sheet, leaving several inches in between.
Flatten the scoops slightly so they are nice and thin.
Bake the crisps for about 15 minutes, but start checking the crisps at about the 11-12 minute mark.
If they have browned significantly, take them out of the oven.
Let the crisps cool and enjoy!
Notes: Inspired by Nutrition Stripped.
Feel free to substitute the coconut flour and sesame seeds for ingredients you can find in your kitchen.



Peel, slice, and core apples.
You will need about 6 large apples.
In a bowl, combine the oats, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon.
Using a pastry blender or fork, cut in butter until mixture resembles course crumbs.
Stir in chopped pecans.
Set aside (this will be your topping).
For the filling, in large mixing bowl combine sliced apples and cinnamon-sugar mixture, then gently toss til combined.
Transfer the filling to your 13x9 pan or 4 to 6 ramekins.
Sprinkle the topping over the filling.
Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped topping!
Yumm!



Combine all ingredients in the blender, until smooth.
Serve immediately.

Drain and arrange in 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and dot with butter.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Crumble rosemary over top
Bake covered about 25 min or until tender.



Combine cranberry sauce and barbecue sauce in slow cooker.
Cover and cook on high 20-30 minutes.
Add meatballs to sauce.
Cover and cook on low 3 hours or until heated through.



1.
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Once the oven reaches 200 degrees, set a timer for 10 minutes.
2.
Using a 2-cup measuring cup, fill it with the warm water.
Sprinkle yeast over the warm water and give it a quick stir so that all of the yeast gets wet.
Be sure to wipe any yeast sticking to the spoon back into the water.
Let the yeast mixture sit for about 5 minutes.
3.
Add bread flour and kosher salt to the large bowl of a stand mixure, and stir a few times to mix.
4.
By this time, the yeast should have started to bloom or look fluffy on the surface of the water.
If not, give it another minute or two.
Add the olive oil into the yeast mixture, and stir it to combine a bit.
The oil wont completely mix with the water.
5.
Turn the mixer on to a medium low setting and gradually pour the yeast and oil mixture into the flour.
Once all the liquid has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium and allow it to mix the dough for one minute.
The dough will be sticky but not gooey.
6.
Pour a little blop (about 1 teaspoon) of olive oil into a large, oven safe bowl.
Take the dough from the mixing bowl, and roll it around in your hands to make a ball.
Put the dough ball into the oil of the other bowl.
Swirl the dough around in the oil, and turn it over to coat the dough completely.
7.
By now, the oven should have been heated to 200 degrees for 10 minutes.
Turn off the oven.
8.
Cover the bowl with the dough in it tightly with plastic wrap.
Place the bowl in the warm oven and close the door.
Now would be an excellent time to verify that you have turned the oven OFF.
9.
Allow dough to rise in the warm oven, in its wrapped bowl for 40 minutes or until dough has doubled in bulk.
Setting a timer is a good idea here, too.
10.
Once the dough has doubled in bulk, remove it from the oven.
Push down dough, and divide in half (or in 8 equal pieces, if you are making mini pizzas or calzones).
Roll pieces into a ball.
What to do from here:
Freeze for later: At this point, you can put the balls of dough into individual zippered freezer bags and freeze for later.
To use, place frozen dough into a large, oiled bowl.
Turn to coat.
Cover with plastic wrap and allow to thaw and rise on the counter for at least 8 hours or until doubled in bulk.
I usually do this first thing in the morning, then it is ready at dinner time.
Make pizza: Roll and/or stretch dough to cover a oiled baking sheet.
Top with sauce and/or the toppings of your choice.
We like to make one pizza brushed with olive oil, shredded cheese, and Italian seasoning, and one with leftover pasta sauce, shredded cheese and pepperoni.
Boring, but tasty.
If I am feeling sassy and want a grown-up pizza, I may put on shredded chicken, carmelized onions, and goat cheese.
Bake in a preheated 500-degree oven for 9-14 minutes, or until cheese is melted, and crust is golden brown.
Make calzone/stuffed pizza: Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, roll or stretch out into a 6-inch (or so) circle.
Pizza toppings make great fillings, just use less wet ingredients and more meat/veggies/cheese.
(Some ideas include browned sausage, cooked, diced potato, onion, and diced roasted red pepper.
Cheese and pepperoni.
Brie with thinly sliced apple and crumbled, cooked bacon.)
Heat filling and place 1/3 cup of warm filling of your choice onto one side of the round, leaving 1/4 inch around the edges.
Fold dough in half over the filling and press the edges to seal.
Then roll about 1/4 inch of the edge from the bottom over the top and press to seal.
Brush the top with olive oil.
Bake in a preheated 450-degree oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
Make focaccia bread: Roll and stretch dough onto a sheet pan.
Brush the top with olive oil.
Sprinkle with a hefty pinch of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning.
Sprinkle with about 1 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese.
You could also add a small amount of another topping, such as caramelized onions and crumbled goat cheese, or sliced black olives.
Bake in a preheated 450-degree oven for 12-18 minutes or until cheese is melted and bread is lightly browned.

Remove sausage from the casings (slide a sharp knife down the center of each sausage and then using your hands just push the meat out from the casing).
Discard the casing.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine the sausage and ground beef in a pan.
Cook over medium heat until browned, continually breaking up the meat and mixing it together.
Cook your pasta according to the directions on the box to make it al dente.
(It is very important not to overcook as you will continue baking it in the oven later.)
Pour your sauce into a large bowl or pot.
Add the ricotta cheese and mix it in completely with the sauce.
Next, add half of the mozzarella cheese to the sauce.
Save the other 1 cup for later.
Add your meat and pasta into the sauce and cheese.
Mix well.
Pour your pasta into a casserole dish.
Use a large pan if cooking the entire amount.
Or split into two smaller (1 1/2 quart) pans to cook one meal now and freeze the other one for later.
Sprinkle the remaining half of the mozzarella cheese on the top of the ziti.
If using two casserole dishes, sprinkle half on one dish and half on the other.
Cover your dish with foil.
Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until the entire dish is hot and the cheese has completely melted on top.



Chop the chocolate bar.
Add margarine, vegetable oil, and white sugar into a bowl, then mix well with a whisk until the mixture becomes white and smooth.
Sift in the cake flour and cocoa powder into the Step 1 bowl.
Blend in with your hands.
Bring them together in one.
It's a crumbly dough, so it doesn't have to be a complete ball.
Do not knead the dough.
Add the chopped chocolate, and lightly mix so that everything is well blended.
The dough is ready.
It's ok that the dough is crumbly like this illustrated in the picture.
Preheat the oven for 160C.
Squeeze the Step 3 dough together using your hands, press onto the parchment paper lined baking pan, and form into shapes by flattening (keep spaces in between the cookies.)
I made 23 4 cm diameter cookies.
Bake in the oven preheated to 160C for 23 minutes.
Each oven is different, so check on your cookies periodically.
When they're done baking, remove form the oven, and let it cool on a rack.
The crispy cookies are done.
This was the previous profile photo.



In bowl, combine 3 cups (750 mL) of the flour, yeast, parsley, sugar, salt and baking soda.
Heat buttermilk, water and butter until 125 F (50 C) or hot to the touch (mixture may curdle).

Put ice cream back in freezer until firm
Serve!
(Also great with vanilla wafers and Lonadoones).



Preheat the oven to 350F, with the rack in the center.
Into a medium bowl, sift together flour and 3/4 cup sugar four times; set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites and the warm water on low speed until foamy.
Add salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla; beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes.
While beating, gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Beat on high speed until peaks are stiff and glossy but not dry, about 2 minutes (do not overmix).
Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Sift flour mixture over egg-white mixture in six parts, quickly but gently folding it in with a rubber spatula after each addition.
Gently transfer batter to an ungreased 10-inch tube pan.
Run a knife through the batter to release any air bubbles, and smooth with a small offset spatula.
Bake until cake is golden brown and springs back when touched, 35 to 40 minutes.
Invert pan onto its legs and let cool completely, about 1 hour.
Carefully run a large offset spatula around the sides of the cake to loosen, then invert onto a wire rack.
Cake can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.
Follow instructions for Classic Angel Food Cake, sifting 1/4 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder and 1 teaspoon baking powder along with the flour and 3/4 cup sugar.
Once cake is completely cool, place on a wire rack set over a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Slowly pour Mocha Glaze (page 389) evenly over the top of the cake, guiding it with a spoon and letting some drip down the sides.
Once the batter is transferred to the pan, run a knife through it to help release any air bubbles.
This will result in a cake with a very fine crumb.



In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, ground black pepper and brown sugar to taste.
Adjust the amounts to your taste.
Mix well and add the steak slices.
Place entire mixture with meat into a sealed plastic container and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
If doing in the oven, place one oven rack on the highest rack setting and one rack on the lowest setting.
Place a piece of aluminum foil OR a baking sheet on the lowest rack, to catch any drippings.
(If doing in your dehydrater, follow your manufactures instructions).
Preheat oven to 160F degrees.
Insert a wooden toothpick through the end of each slice of meat, and suspend each slice from the top rack in the oven, using the toothpick as a support for the slice.
Bake at 160 degrees F (with the oven door propped open to allow moisture to escape).
Bake for 6 to 8 hours depending on thickness of slices.
Jerky should bend, and not snap.



Combine all the ingredients (of your choice of spice blend) in a mixing bowl.
Mix well.
Spice blends can be stored in an airtight container in your spice cabinet for up to 3 months.



In mixer combine first four ingredients.
Mix until combined.
Add hot water and mix on low for 1-2 minutes.
Scrape the bowl so all the flour is mixed.
Let sit for 10 minutes.
Add salt, oil and lemon juice.
Mix.
Add the white flour about 1/2 cup at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides.
Mix for about 7-8 minutes until you can pull a window pane with the dough.
Form into three loaves and put into greased loaf pans.
Put into oven but DO NOT TURN OVEN ON AT THIS TIME.
Let rise until dough is almost at the top of the pan, about 45 minutes.
DO NOT TAKE PANS OUT OF THE OVEN.
Just turn oven on to 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
Let cook in the pans for 10-15 minutes.
Turn out and finish cooking on a wire rack.



See the note below about the potato.
Place the raw potato and 1 cup of the water in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil and cook until the potato is done (it slides off a knife when pierced), about 10-15 minutes.
After boiling, you will be left with around 1/4 cup of the water.
Drain the potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water in a small bowl.
Add 3/4 cup of fresh water to the reserved water.
Place a thermometer inside the water and wait until it cools down to 108-115 F.
Once the water has cooled to the ideal temperature range, add the yeast and a pinch of sugar.
Stir to dissolve, and then let it rest until foamy, about 5 minutes.
If the yeast does not foam, its dead.
If this happens youll need to start over with fresh water and fresh yeast.
If this does happen to you, you can use 1 cup of plain water for this stepno need to boil extra potatoes).
Next, add the sugar, melted butter, and potato pieces to the bowl with the yeast.
Stir very well to combine.
Add the flour, and mix until combined.
Grab the dough in one hand, and smear some butter up the sides and across the bottom of the bowl.
Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for 45 minutes-1 hour, or until doubled.
If your kitchen is cool, turn on the oven to 200 F for 5 minutes, turn it off, and place the bowl inside to rise.
After rising is complete, the dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight to bake in the morning.
Ive had great results making the dough the night before.
Next, well roll out the dough and fill it.
Dust the counter lightly with flour, and dump the dough onto the flour.
Pat out the dough into a 6 square.
Pour on the melted butter.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon.
Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the melted butter.
Let it sit for a minute or so, until the butter absorbs the brown sugar and cinnamon.
This will help the filling from falling out when rolling.
Gently, roll up the square, starting on the side of the dough closest to you.
Roll it tightly into a log, and pinch the edge together when you get to the end.
Slice the roll in half, then place both halves in a greased loaf pan, cut side up.
Let the rolls rise in the loaf pan in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Bake the rolls in the oven for 25 minutes.
The rolls will be brown when done; dont be afraid of color.
Take the rolls out of the oven.
In a small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, powdered sugar and milk.
Pour the glaze on the warm rolls, and serve.
Note: Most russet potatoes weigh more than 5 ounces, so either grab a tiny organic one, or pull out 5 ounces worth of raw potatoes while making mashed potatoes the night before.



Serve melons drizzled with juice, then dolloped with yogurt.

Place dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap for 20 minutes.
After the dough has rested, break off eight sections, roll them into balls in your hands, place on a plate (make sure they arent touching) and then cover balls with damp cloth or plastic wrap for 10 minutes.
(Its very important to let the dough rest, otherwise it will be like elastic and wont roll out to a proper thickness and shape.
).
After dough has rested, one at a time place a dough ball on a floured surface, pat it out into a four-inch circle, and then roll with a rolling pin from the center until its thin and about eight inches in diameter.
(If you roll out pie crusts youll have no problem with this.)
Dont over work the dough, or itll be stiff.
Keep rolled-out tortillas covered until ready to cook.
In a dry iron skillet or comal heated on high, cook the tortilla about thirty seconds on each side.

You'll need 2 cans and a good can opener.
I like to use the cans that are left from pie filling (21 oz).
They are kinda wide and I find them easier to work with.
They must be cleaned and free of dents (dents will stop the cake from popping out).
The important thing is to open the cans cleanly with no jagged edges which will tear the cakes when removing them and cut your hands.
The second important thing is to grease and flour the can very well and line the bottom with a little circle of greased parchment paper.
You can use the standard butter or shortening and flour but I prefer to spray them with Baker's Joy.
It's just so much simpler.
I make the recipes right in a 4 cup measuring cup and then simply pour/scrape the batter into the center of the cans.
If you don't have one of those, drop the batter off of a serving spoon into the center of the can.
Try to smooth the tops a little with a narrow rubber spatula.
Tap the cans on the counter gently to remove air pockets.
Bake according to your recipe.
Test for doneness using a long thin skewer.
After you bake the cake according to the recipe, let it cool on a rack for 10 minutes just like usual then run a thin knife around the edge of the cake and pop it out.
Cool completely on the rack.
If the cake gets totally stuck, cut the bottom of the can off with your can opener and push the cake gently up out of the can (sort of like a push-up pop ice cream).
Gently remove the can bottom from the cake with a thin knife.
Once the cake is cool, carefully slice it in half horizontally to make your 2 layers.
Fill and frost according to your recipe.
Be very careful during this whole process not to cut yourself on the rims of the cans and supervise children when they're handling the cans.
Replace the cans after 2 or 3 uses or when you see any rusting or discoloration.

Drop the butter pieces into the bowl, tossing them once or twice just to coat them with flour.
With a pastry blender, work the butter into the flour, aiming for pieces of butter that range in size from bread crumbs to small peas.
The smaller pieces will make the dough tender; the larger ones will make it flaky.
Sprinkle the cold sour cream mixture over the dough, one tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork to evenly distribute it.
After youave added all of the sour cream, the dough should be moist enough to stick together when pressed; if itas not, add additional cold water, one teaspoon at a time.
(Temptation will be to add too much water; this is not a wet dough.)

In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or using a hand mixer, mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute.
Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture.
(You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.)
In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together.
With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms.
(You should still see small bits of butter.)
Transfer the dough to a work surface and shape into a round, flat disk.
Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using.
Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using.
If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)
When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature to make it more workable.
Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand.
Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes.
Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center.
Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling.
The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm.
If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour.
Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter.
Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 12 inches wide for a 10-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.
Set your pie pan nearby.
To transfer the crust to the pan, I find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan.
Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan.
Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.
Don't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it.
Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners.
If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; we'll patch it in a minute.
Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim.
Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.
To decorate the rim, fold under the excess dough then just press it all around with the back of a fork.
For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together.
Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a "V" with the dough in between.
.
Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.
If baking with the filling, chill until ready.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface.
Knead by hand until the cheese and onions are completely worked into the dough.
(The dough will feel rather tight.)
Gather it into a smooth ball.
Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Fold the dough gently over on itself in three or four places, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and cut it into 20 equal pieces.

In a microwave safe dish (I used a Pyrex pie plate), place the nuts evenly in a single layer (coat them in the fat, if using).
Microwave on HIGH heat for 2 minutes, stir, and continue to cook and stir at one minute intervals, until nuts are fragrant and light golden brown in color.
Be careful not to let them scorch.
Use potholders.
(Note: total cook time is about 5 minutes for whole nuts-- smaller amounts or sliced nuts or sesame seeds could be done in as little as 2 minutes, larger amounts of nuts will take longer and not cook as evenly, therefore 1/2 cup of nuts is optimal for even cooking.
The optional addition of the fat will speed cooking time somewhat).
IMPORTANT SAFETY TIPS: Be sure to use potholders as the dish will become hot.
Do NOT add water to the hot dish, as it may crack.
Microwave heating times vary, so use caution.
Let cool at room temperature.
Use in recipes or for snacking.

Bring this to a rolling boil and boil for 2 1/2 minutes -- (test it by taking a cup of cold water and putting a spoonful of the mixture into the cold water.
If it forms a ball it has boiled long enough.
If it does not form a ball, it is not done yet.
This may take 3 minutes.
).
Turn off heat and add the peanut butter.
Stir until it is mixed and then with heavy spoon mix in the oats and stir all together and drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper.



Use your bread maker: Put everything into the bread maker and start the dough course.
Put the yeast in the designated compartment.
Leave it up to the bread maker until the first rising.
After it has risen the first time: Since my bread maker is only for 1 loaf of bread, it overflowed.
If it begins to overflow during the rising process, remove the lid of the bread maker and cover it with plastic wrap instead.
Remove from the case and punch down the dough.
Divide the dough into two portions using a scraper.
Form each portion into round balls, cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 15 minutes.
After letting them rest, they should have expanded a little.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until about 30 cm long.
Fold it into thirds and then roll it up starting with the side closest you.
Tightly seal the seams closed.
Do the same for the other portion.
Place into the bread pan with the seam side down.
Spray the dough with water, cover with a lid, and let them rise a second time for about 30 minutes.
When they have risen so that they are only 2 cm from the top of the pan, they are done rising
Close the lid and bake in a preheated 200C oven for 30 minutes.
After it has baked, remove from the pan and let it cool on a cooling rack.
It's done.



Preheat oven for 400 degrees farenheit.
Mix all of the ingredients in large bowl, except for the 1 cup flour and 1 cup self rising corn meal mix at the end - set these aside, and blend until a soft dough forms.
slowly add in more flour from the flour that has been set aside, and knead into the soft dough until a firmer dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
fold out onto corn meal mix dusted surface (use from the cup of mix that was set aside) and sprinkle with more of the corn meal mix.
roll out to 1/2" thickness sprinkling more of the corn meal mix onto the dough surface as needed to prevent your rolling pin from sticking.
use biscuit cutter or coffe cup and cut out your biscuits and put them onto a cookie sheet dusted with corn meal mix and bake until golden brown and then enjoy.
you can also add cranberries, onions, or cheese to this too and can omit the bouillion if you want to make it sweet, add 1 cup of sugar and 2Tbs.vanilla extract instead and add your other ingredients you want to use -- i.e.
chocolate chips, fruit, etc --.
the serving size and yields are approximate depending on what size biscuit cutter or shape you use -- .
And if you want to make a biscuit for your pooch - get regular corn meal and replace the self-rising corn meal mix with this and roll out very thin and cut the biscuits out with bone,star or, round shaped small cutters and bake until very light brown and let cool overnight to make them hard -- or you can then put them back into the oven after coating them with egg whites and baking it on for a few minutes on a lower temp until glossy if you want but it's not necessary -- p.s.
my dog loved these too -- .

Lightly flour a 2- to 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and cut the biscuits, leaving as little space between each cut as possible and pressing down just once for each biscuit; do not twist the cutter.
If the dough begins to stick to the cutter, dip the cutter in a little flour.
Gather the excess biscuit dough, reroll once, and cut as many biscuits from it as possible.
Arrange the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the biscuits have risen and are golden brown.
Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the melted butter.
Because biscuits are made with so few ingredients, the quality of each one is of utmost importance.
That probably accounts for why Southerners are so famously particular about the kind of flour and shortening they use in their biscuits.
My mother swears by Martha White flour and Crisco, whereas Iand many othersfavor White Lily flour, a brand that is practically synonymous with Southern baking.
As for shortening, there are factions that favor lard, those that favor vegetable shortening, and those that favor butter.
I use mostly butter for its superior flavor, but I typically add just a little bit of vegetable shortening or lard for extra flakiness.
Here are some quick tips that practically guarantee perfect biscuits every time.
For the softest biscuits, always use flour that has a low gluten content.
All purpose flour is a safe bet, and certain brands, such as White Lily and Martha White, are known for being extra soft.
Steer clear of whole-wheat or bread flour.
Do not add more flour than is needed to keep the dough from sticking together; if you add too much, the dough will be tough.
Do not mix or work the dough any more than is necessary to bring it together.
Never roll biscuit dough more than twice or your biscuits will be tough.
Any scraps left over from the second rolling can be wrapped around cooked sausage links and baked as pigs-in-blankets (see Saras Swaps, page 68) or baked as they arethey wont look as nice but theyll taste just as good!
Dip the biscuit cutter in flour to keep the dough from sticking to the cutter.
To allow your biscuits to more fully rise, cut straight down with the biscuit cutter and resist the urge to twist.
For biscuits with soft sides, bake them nestled up next to each other so the sides are touching.
For crispy sides, leave a one-inch space between the biscuits.
For a fail-proof way of cutting the butter into the flour without any danger of the butter melting, freeze the butter for several hours or overnight and then simply use a grater to grate the butter into the flour.
Rotate the pan halfway through baking for even cooking and color.

Serve immediately.
Cool left overs, wrap with plastic wrap and freeze as soon as possible.
NOTE.
There's two things to remember when making biscuits.
-Keepthings cold so the butter does not melt.
The process of cutting the butter into the flour actually coats the flour with a light layer of grease to prevent it from absorbing liquid and creating gluten-- which will make the product tough and more bread like.
If the butter starts to get soft while working it into the flour then refrigerate the batch for 20 mins before going on.
-Workfast and gently.
Only mix as much as necessary to do the job.
Over working dough develops gluten.



Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until the consistency is achieved.
Cover and refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving to chill thoroughly.
Should last for up to 2 month in the refrigerator IF MILK IS NOT ADDED.



Add chocolate to the top half of a double boiler set over about 1-inch of simmering water (or place it in a medium bowl that fits over a medium saucepan with about the same amount of simmering water).
Stir until half the chocolate has melted, then remove the top half of the double boiler from the heat and continue stirring until all the chocolate has melted; set aside to cool for 5 minutes.
Soften the butter in a large bowl, using an electric mixer at medium speed, about 2 minutes.
Add in powdered sugar; beat the mixture at medium speed about 1 minute until smooth.
Beat in the vanilla, then the cooled melted chocolate until uniform.
Remove the beaters and stir in the flour and salt with a wooden spoon, just until moistened and incorporated but not sticky.
The dough should be soft but hold together; let stand 5 minutes.
Sprinkle a few drops of water on your work surface; lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on top; turn the chocolate dough onto the plastic wrap; flatten into a thick, round disk; then cover with a second large sheet of pastic wrap.
Roll to a circle about 1/2 inch thick (thinner for crisper cookies, but no thinner than 1/3 inch).
Using the plastic wrap, transfer the circle of dough to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm and cold, about 1 hour, but not more than 2 hours.
Position the rack in the center of the oven; preheat oven to 350; line a second large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat; set aside.
Remove the circle of dough from the refrigerator, then transfer if from the baking sheet to your work surface; remove the top sheet of plastic wrap and cut the dough into large, circular cookies, using a 3-inch cookie cutter.
Transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheet, spacing cookies 1-inch apart.
Use the back of a flatware knife to score each of these rounds into 6 pie-wedge sections (do not cut through).
You can also make small, dotlike indentations in the sections with the tip of the knife if you likebut again do not poke through to the baking sheet.
**If all the cookies will not fit on one baking sheet, line another with parchment paper or silicone baking mat, transfer these cookies to it, then place in the refrigerator until the first batch has baked; let stand at room temperature for 3 minutes before placing in the oven.
Bake for 6 minutes, reverse the sheet from back to front; continue baking for about 6 more minutes, or until rounds are dry but soft.
The tops should have tiny, raised air pockets, somewhat like goosebumps.
The cookies should give a bit when toucheddo not overbake.
Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
**Noteyou can cut rolled dough into any number of shapes; smaller shapes require a shorter baking time.

Use a hand mixer and mix the dough on low for 3 minutes, then let it sit for 10 minutes.
Then repeat, mixing for another 3 minutes and letting it sit for 10.
Remove the dough with a silicone spatula and drop it into a large oiled bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for 45 minutes.
Use the same silicone spatula and drop the dough onto a floured surface.
Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour.
Take one end of the dough and fold it up into the middle.
Take the other end, and fold that one into the middle.
Sprinkle more flour on top of the dough and let it sit for 15 minutes.
Then repeat these steps again.
Take the bread and create an 8x8 inch square.
Use a sharp knife and cut the square in half.
Cover each of the loaves with a light dish towel and let it sit for about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 475 F while it sits.
Gently lift the loaves onto a greased baking sheet, trying to touch them the least amount possible.
Bake for 17-25 minutes (mine was ready after 17 exactly so Id keep an eye on it a little before that time).
Remove from oven.
Let it cool on a cooling rack and then slice it up and serve!

Take a microwave-safe container and loose fitting lid.
Place your fruit cup or serving of fruit in with the flour.
I use the little pre-measured/pre-portioned fruit cup snack things for kids.
I think Dole and Walmart make them.
Anyways, they are the best for this.
But you can also use one serving of any fruit or fruit mix (i.e.
pears, peaches in syrup, pineapple chunks, fruit cocktail, etc.)
as long as it is in syrup or juice.
Be sure it is one serving according to the can directions.
The fruit cups I use are 113 grams.
Mix the ingredients until all is moist or wet.
Spread the fruit evenly along the container.
Now microwave the mix with the lid loosely on for about 45 seconds.
If the center is still liquidy you can heat more or use it as a dip or topping for whatever you like.
I recommend heating longer but be cautious not to over cook and dry the edges out.
Wait for it to cool and then enjoy.
I commonly eat this with yogurt, ice cream, marshmallow creme, or Cool Whip.
As for the dipping into the batter, if you will, I use animal crackers or fig newtons.
I do warn you that it is kinda tangy or sour like.
I have a weird taste for that sort of thing.
TO Lollyskid: You may have different tastes than me, that is if you used the Great Value (Walmart) version of "pineapple tidbits" and just the one little serving to 1/4 cup flour.
I am sure you can find something on here though.
Right now, I can say from experience of testing different types, my favorite is the pineapple tidbits in syrup with a side of ice cream.
It is tangy, sweet and very nice.

Soak an hour's worth of pecan shells in water in the morning.
(about 2 handfuls)
Smoke the tasso with charcoal and pecan shells a total of about 2 hours.
There is no way to check the internal temperature of the pork since it is so thin, but it will be done when the texture is close to jerky.
When completely cool, portion and store the Tasso in vacuum sealed packages and freeze.
Only apply about 1 hour of pecan shell smoke to the tasso.
Let the charcoal finish cooking it.



In a saucepan on low heat, melt the butter.
Whisk in the flour, salt, and mustard powder.
Slowly whisk in the milk, making sure there aren't any lumps.

Use fresh asparagus with thin stalks - I have found the older and thicker the stalk, the stringer the end result will be.
It does not affect taste for me, but texture is a big part of my meal as well.
In a sheet pan lay out asparagus.
(I usually add ingredients right on food).
Drizzle veggies with oil (toss around).
Sprinkle garlic powder over veggies (toss again to coat).
Place in preheated HOT oven (400 degrees).
Cook for 7- 10 minutes.
Garlic powder will burn, so keep an eye on your asparagus.
I usually start to check when I can hear frying.
I will also take them out after 3 minutes and flip - I like them toasty.
Pierce thickest stalk to check for tenderness.
salt to taste.
Serve hot for best result - but will be ok if warm.
I like to pair them with beef dishes because gravy sets this dish off perfectly.

Place the rice malt into a plastic container and break it up by hand if there are lumps.
Add salt and firmly close the lid, and shake the container to mix.
It's not a big deal if you add too much water on the first day.
Pour in the measured water slowly, just enough to cover the rice malt.
Cover with plastic wrap, close the lid, and store at room temperature.
The rice malt will swell from soaking the water by the second day.
Add just enough water to cover the rice malt completely, and mix.
It seems better to mix it daily, but you can mix it once every 2-3 days and that is OK, too.
If the rice malt and water separates, mix well.
It is done once it has thickened most of the way through, about 1 week-10 days.
Remove the plastic wrap once it is done, cover with a lid, and store in the fridge.
This is the rice malt I used.
It is already broken up, so it is easy to use.
If there are any lumps, break by hand and mix.
Once you have used up 1/3-1/2 of the shio-koji, make a new batch in a separate container and then add that into the old batch.

Lightly coat the shrimp with the tapioca starch or cornstarch.
In a small bowl, mix the salt with the freshly ground peppercorns and set aside.
Heat the oil to 360 degrees Fahrenheit in a deep fat fryer, heavy saucepan with deep sides or a second wok (it is easiest not to deep-fry and stir-fry the shrimp in the same wok).
Carefully add the shrimp to the hot oil, 4 to 5 at a time, and deep-fry until they turn bright orange (about 40 seconds).
Make sure the temperature does not fall below 350F (180C) Fahrenheit.
Carefully remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Continue deep-frying the remainder of the shrimp.
Heat a wok on medium heat.
Add the salt and pepper mixture and the deep-fried shrimp.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Grease a cookie sheet or 9x13 baking pan with 2 tablespoons bacon grease or oil; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, baking soda and about 3 cups of flour.
Stir until combined and mixture is stiff enough to knead on a board, adding additional flour to reach kneading consistency.
Generously flour a bread board or counter top; scrape dough out onto floured board and knead 8-10 times, turning dough on the last kneading, smoothing and patting it out with your hand until its about 1 inch thick, no thicker.
Note: dont overwork the dough.
Better to under-knead than to over-work.
The less you work the dough, the more tender the biscuits will be and the higher they will rise.
Using a biscuit cutter or a tomato sauce can with both ends cut out, cut biscuits and place into greased baking pan with sides touching.
Knead trimmings and pat out dough, cutting more biscuits.
As before, handle the dough as little as possible.
After all biscuits are in the pan, grease the tops of the biscuits with bacon grease or oil and place in the hot oven.
Watch carefully, as different ovens get hotter, bake differently, etc.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, watching carefully.
When biscuits are golden brown on top, check for done-ness by lifting the corner of one of the middle biscuits.
If the top lifts and the inside is fluffy but not sticky, biscuits are done.
Remove from the oven and dump biscuits onto a wire rack, cloth-lined bread basket or onto a clean kitchen towel to cool a bit, then serve hot.
This recipe yields about 2 dozen biscuits according to the size and thickness of your biscuits.
Enjoy!
This is the same recipe for biscuits that my Mama made every day when I was growing up and until she died in April 2005 at the age of 76.

Make the starter by mixing the yeast with the water (no need to do this if you're using instant yeast), then mixing in the flour to make a soft dough.
Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well.
The starter should have risen and become bubbly.
If it hasn't, your yeast may not be working.
Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of yeast in 1 tablespoon lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar, and wait 15 minutes.
If nothing happens, replace your yeast, and begin the starter process again.
If you're using active dry yeast, mix it with the water, then combine with the starter, flour, and salt.
If you're using instant yeast, there's no need to combine it with the water first.
Mix and knead everything togetherby hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycletill you've made a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough.
Knead for about 5 minutes on speed 2 of a stand mixer.
Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-size bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise for 3 hours, gently deflating it and turning it over after 1 hour, and then again after 2 hours.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface.
Divide it into three equal pieces.
Shape each piece into a rough, slightly flattened oval, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let them rest for 15 minutes.
Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the dough in half lengthwise, and seal the edges with the heel of your hand.
Flatten it slightly, and fold and seal again.
With the seam-side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 15" log.
Place the logs seam-side down into the wells of a baguette pan; or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans.
*.
Cover them with a cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise till they've become very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.
Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450F; if you're using a baking stone, place it on the lowest rack.
Using a very sharp knife held at about a 45 angle, make three 8" vertical slashes in each baguette.
Spritz the baguettes heavily with warm water; this will help them develop a crackly-crisp crust.
Bake the baguettes until they're a very deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack.
Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2", and allow the baguettes to cool in the oven.
*Advanced baker version: Place the shaped baguettes, seam-side down, in the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel.
Allow them to rise as directed.
When fully risen, gently roll them onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet, floured side down.
Bake as directed.
Or roll them onto a baker's peel, and then onto a heated pizza stone in the oven.
Bake as directed above.
Variation: Make six stuffed sandwiches, perfect for picnics or lunchboxes.
Stuffed Baguettes.
Divide the baguette dough into six pieces instead of three, and shape each into a 5"-long rectangle.
Layer with your favorite filling; we like mustard, ham, and Swiss cheese.
Don't use too much filling, as it'll make the baguettes soggy.
Also, use a dry filling (e.g., sliced deli meat, cheese) rather than something wet like meatballs in sauce.
Roll up like a jelly roll, sealing the long seam and pinching the ends closed.
Place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
Slash each baguette twice lengthwise, if desired.
The cheese will ooze out.
Some people like this look; some don't.
Your choice.
Bake until golden brown, as directed above.
You may need shorten the baking time a bit from the original recipe.
Tips from our KAF bakers.
The ingredients in baguettes are pure simplicity: flour, water, salt, and yeast.
It's the baker's technique that turns an average baguette into an all-star.
The more you practice your baguette-baking techniques, the better the baguette you'll make.
Don't expect perfection the first time out!
Why the small amount of yeast and the extra-long rise?
Because as yeast grows, it releases organic acids and alcohol, both of which are flavor carriers.
The extra-long rise will give your baguettes outstanding flavor.

Place all ingredients, except for the sunflower seeds, into the mixing pan in the order recommended for your brand of breadmaker.
In our breadmaker we put wet ingredients first, then dry ingredients, then yeast.
Place sunflower seeds into the fruit and nut dispenser of your breadmaker or, if you don't have a dispenser, keep them aside until later.
Set breadmaker settings to WHOLEWEAT, MEDIUM (crust), and LARGE (size)- this recipe makes a 1250g loaf.
If your breadmaker has a fruit and nut dispenser, set it to dispense the nuts eg NUTS YES.
Press START.
Check the consistency of the dough during the kneading stage and add a little more water or flour if the dough seems too dry or too wet.
If you don't have a fruit and nut dispenser, add the sunflower seeds towards the end of the first knead.
Check loaf again towards the end of the final rise and if necessary, use your hand to form it into a neater shape.
When the BAKE cycle is finished, remove the loaf from the pan and cool on a rack.
To give the loaf a nice shiny finish, spray with spray oil while it is still warm.

I find putting this in the microwave for a minute heats it sufficiently to mix the ingredients.
Add liquid to the dry ingredients and mix well.
Spread out on a large baking tray and bake in the oven for 30/40 minutes.
You will need to stir/turn it occasionally until evenly browned.
I wait until it is done then turn off the oven and leave the door open.
This way it seems to fully dry out and stays crisp for longer.
When cool add the apricots, cut into thin slivers.
Mix and store in an airtight tub.
A nice alternative is to use pecan nuts instead of hazlenuts.
Do crush/chop the nuts yourself though as, if you buy the uniformly shop bought chopped ones, the texture is all wrong.

In a separate bowl, whisk the pumpkin, sugar, yogurt and milk together.
Gently stir in your dry ingredients, being careful not to over mix.
By now the dates should be nice and soft.
Remove them from whatever water is left and pour into a food processor along with the honey and cinnamon.
(I used a mini food processor but a larger one or even a blender would work.)
Puree until smooth.
Using a 1/4 cup, scoop the dough onto greased cookie sheets.
Using a spoon, press a small dent into the center of each biscuit and fill with the date puree.
Bake at 375 degrees F for approximately 18 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

Stir until blended, making sure all the yeast is dissolved.
Into the yeast mixture stir the remaining water, white sugar,1 heaping T. of salt and oil.
Beat, then stir in, 1 cup at a time, the flour.
Mix until it requires muscle.
You may not need all the flour.
The dough should hang together and be easy to handle, but still a little moist.
On a floured surface, place the dough, sprinkle with more flour as needed, and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic.
This usually takes about 8 minutes.
Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with plastic and a nice heavy towel, and let rise in a warm draft free place.
( I usually only bake bread on sunny days.
).
Let dough rise for 1-2 hours or until it's doubled in size.
When you stick your finger in the dough the imprint should remain.
Punch the dough down and form into loaves.
Place the loaves into well greased loaf pans, cover and let rise again- about an hour.

I love Warm STEAMING Brown rice cooked in a steamer.
I have a Black and Decker Handy Steamer.
The directions are: 1/3 c. brown rice and 2/3 c. water.
Steam for 40 min.
Yields about 1-1/2 c. of rice.
Thedirections go all the way up to 4-1/2 c. cooked rice.
I have been making my rice in it for about 4 yrs.
and it has turned out perfect every time.
Moist and fluffy!
Hey, gotta run and make some.
Suddenly got an urge for a BIG BOWL of Warm STEAMED BROWN RICE.



Combine the walnuts and orange rind in a bowl.
Set aside.
In a saucepan, combine the cream and honey.

Pour the honey mixture over the walnuts, stir to combine.
Place tablespoonfuls on a lightly oiled oven tray.
Refrigerate until set.
Store in an airtight container between layers of baking paper in refrigerator or in a cool place.



Combine all ingredients in a blender except for the poppy seeds.
Blend well and add poppy seeds.
Refrigerate.
This keeps forever in the frig.



Preheat oven to 425F Grease a baking tray or line the baking tray with parchment paper.
Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together.
Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
Stir in the blueberries.
Add the milk and mix to make a smooth dough (you may not need all of the milk).
Knead lightly for ten seconds on a lightly floured surface.
Roll to about 3/4" thick and either cut into individual scones or cut into wedges.
Bake for approximately 8-12 minutes.



Put spinach and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Simmer 5-10 minutes until spinach is tender and breaks apart easily.
Remove from heat.
Do not drain.
Use a spoon to chop spinach somewhat.
It should break up easily.
If it doesn't, cook it a little more.
Mix flour, salt, baking powder and a few sprinkles of mixed pepper in a mixing bowl.
Add olive oil and mix well, using your hands if necessary.
You don't need to over mix, just try to lightly spread the oil throughout the flour mixture.
Add the cooked spinach with water and stir to blend well.
The dough will most likely be sticky.
Add flour a little at a time until dough is soft but easy to handle, kneading it in with your hands.
It is better if the dough is still a little tacky because it will pick up flour when you roll the tortillas.
Lay the dough out on a floured board and make a tube shape.
Cut into 8 equal size pieces.
I cut the tube in half, than half each half, than half each quarter to make 8 fairly equal sized pieces.
Set aside the pieces.
Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough around in your hand to make a ball.
Place on floured board and using a rolling pin, roll it into a flat circle about 9-10 inches in diameter.
As you roll, lift edges and check periodically to make sure dough is not sticking to the board.
Add flour to the top or bottom as needed to keep dough from sticking.
Use as little flour as possible.
Too much flour worked into the dough will make it hard.
Heat a 10-inch cast iron griddle on the stove over medium heat.
If you prefer, use a paper towel dipped in olive oil and spread over pan lightly.
Do not let pan get too hot and smoke.
Lay tortilla in pan and cook each side for about 1-2 minutes.
Remove from pan and lay flat on a plate.
Repeat with each piece of dough, oiling pan as preferred between tortillas.
If pan gets too hot during cooking, remove from burner for a few minutes to cool slightly, but pan should be hot when you place the tortilla on the surface.
Do not overcook your tortillas.
If your pan is not hot enough, it takes too long to cook the tortilla and it will become tough and lose its softness.
To store, stack tortillas with a piece of waxed paper between each one and seal in plastic bag.
Freeze for two weeks or store in fridge for several days.
If frozen, let thaw completely at room temperature to avoid breaking when separating.
Reheat filled tortilla over a griddle or in the microwave.
Do not overheat in microwave as the tortilla will become tough.



Mix together and baste meat.

When the rice is cool enough to handle, sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon of salt on your hands, take 1/4 of the rice and squeeze it together.
When it comes together in a ball, form it into a triangle with your hands.
Your goal is for it to be in the shape as shown in the picture for easier grilling.
Continue until you have four triangles and all the rice is used up, salting your hands with 1/4 teaspoon of salt before making each one.
Heat oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat.
Grill the triangles and when the bottom starts to get crispy, rotate it onto another side.
Continue until all sides are crispy.
Lower heat to medium and brush soy sauce on all sides of the triangles.
Continue grilling for another 5-10 minutes, brushing and rotating every other minute or so.
Note: This recipe is gluten-free if you use gluten-free soy sauce.

Measure rice and put in a heavy 4 quart saucepan.
Wash rice, rubbing it through your fingers in several changes of water until the water is almost clear.
(this rids the rice of excess starch and prevents crust from sticking to the pan when cooking.
).
Cover with water by at least 1 inch and add 2 tablespoons of the salt; stir.
Let stand at least 2 hours; turn into a colander and drain water.
Using the same saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat.
Add the remaining tablespoon of salt, then sprinkle in the soaked rice, keeping the water at a boil.
Stir once to keep from sticking to the bottom, then boil over medium heat, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
Remove rice from heat and drain in a colander.
Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in the same, dry, saucepan.
Stir in the oil and yogurt.
Spoon half the rice in lightly, then sprinkle on the currents, and top with the remaining rice.
Dot with remaining 5 tablespoons of butter, cut into small pieces.
Put a double thickness of paper toweling on top of the pan, then a tight-fitting lid.
Turn heat to medium and cook until you hear the rice sizzling, 5 to 8 minutes, to form the crust.
Then turn heat to as low as possible, and let rice steam 1 hour.
(a little shorter or longer time doesn't matter).
Remove rice and set pan in cold water a few minutes.
This will help loosen the crust which has formed on the bottom.
Loosen edges around rice with a spatula.
Put a serving platter over the top; invert rice onto platter.
If cooked properly, the rice should unmold with the crust on top.
(if not, no problem- just scrape out the crust as best as you can and place on top of rice.
It will still be attractive!
).
To prepare in advance, complete all steps, but be certain to unmold immediately on an overproof platter.
Reheat, loosely covered with foil, in a 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of water before reheating to keep rice from being too dry.

Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold.
When the cranberry mixture is cold, stir in the milk and heavy cream.
Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.



Put all of the ingredients into a heat resistant bowl and microwave for 7 minutes.
Once you take the bowl out, the oil will have separated, so whisk well with an egg beater.
Once you've finished mixing, microwave for another 3 minutes.
If it's still a little watery, heat it for one more minute.
Once the mixture resembles condensed milk, mix well again and heat it for another minute.
Once it has started to bubble slightly, it will become easy for the caramel to burn.
Microwave for 20 seconds at a time until it turns the proper color.
Pour the caramel on a sheet of parchment paper and chill in the fridge or freezer.
Just cut it and it's finished.
As per a comment from Cookpad user "Yuka324," the microwave time differs by microwave maker.
Please adjust the time slightly to your microwave.

Cook's Notes: I use the shortcut of bottled barbecue sauce.
Apple juice adds to the apple flavor of the rib sauce.
It also creates steam inside the foil pack so the ribs don't dry out.
If you don't have apple juice you can use orange or pineapple juice, stock/broth or just plain old water.



Pour the apple juice and pineapple into a blender; add the yogurt, pineapple chunks, and frozen strawberries and blend until smooth.

Place cookies onto cooling racks to cool completely.



Soften the cream cheese in the microwave 1 minute at a time on low setting, until it can be stirred.
Finely chop the beef.
Finely chop the olives and onion.
(I use a hand chopper).
Mix all ingredients in a medium bowl.
Cover and let stand a few hours or overnight.
Serve chilled, or at room temperature, with your favorite dip crackers.



In a saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, golden syrup and chocolate.
Cook and stir until butter and chocolate have melted and everything is well blended.
Mix in the cornflakes cereal.
Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto waxed paper or a buttered baking sheet.
Place in the refrigerator until set, about 15 minutes.



Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water and let proof.
Stir in 4 cups of flour and beat until smooth.
Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
Beat in the salt and then add enough remaining flour to make a stiff dough.
Knead until as soft and smooth as a bambino's behind.
Turn in a greased bowl, cover, and let double in size.
(I put it in the oven with the light on - perfect rising temperature.)
Once doubled, punch down and divide into three.
Place back in the bowl, cover, and let rise.
Once doubled again, punch down and form into three fat "footballs."
Grease heavy cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal.
Place the bread on the sheets, cover with a towel, and let rise.
Once risen, mist with water and place in a preheated 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven.
Mist loaves with water and turn occasionally while they bake.
Bread is done when golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.



Mix dressing, let set in refrigerator 3 to 4 hrs.
Add in dressing to salad.
Mix gently and chill.



Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine apples and brown sugar in a large Dutch oven.
Bake for 30 minutes.
Combine milk, flour, and oats.
Pour mixture over apples and brown sugar.
Bake for 1 hour.
Serve.



Sift flour and salt into a mixing bowl and add the water with oil.
Stir until forms soft dough, then knead in the bowl about 10 minutes.
Dough will feel sticky at first, but kneading, it should develop into a dough that becomes smooth and satiny.
When well mixed and smooth, wrap pastry in plastic wrap and leave it to rest at room temperature about one hour.
If not all the dough is being used right away, wrap the unused portion and keep chilled in fridge up to a week.
Always bring to room temp before using.
Divide the pastry into 12 equal portions, shaping them into smooth balls.
Cover with a cloth, except the one you're working with.
Take a ball of dough, and shape it into a square.
Place it on a lightly floured surface, and roll into a 6 inch square using rolling pin.
Dust again with flour.
Take the dowel, and place on one end of the pastry, and roll neatly onto the dowel, pressing firmly as you do so.
Keep hands on each side of the pastry.
Unroll the pastry and dust the work surface and pastry with a little flour, and roll up again from opposite side as before, exerting pressure as you go.
Unroll carefully.
After second rolling, the pastry should be about 10x12 inches.
Using the back of your hands, place them under the pastry and stretch gently, moving hands to keep it even, working toward the edges.
The edges can be given a final stretch with the fingertips.
You should wind up with a pastry that's 14x18 inches in size.
Place on a cloth, cover with wax paper and fold the cloth over the top.
Repeat the above process with remaining dough balls, laying each on top of the previous one with wax paper between them.
Use soon after making as they'll go sour if you keep them too long.
If desired, you can roll them out more thinly.
Repeating the dowel rolling process more will result in a thinner square each time.
Phyllo can be used like a puff pastry when thicker, or it's wonderful in baklawa, lamb pastries, or many other mid eastern sweets when rolled very thin.
In Greece, they'll often use phyllo as a crust for certain types of pies, such as spinach.



Preheat the oven to 450F.
Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Place the flour and salt in a large bowl and stir to mix.
Add the cream and stir to mix just until the flour is moist.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead three or four times, just until it comes together, and form into a flat disk.
Using a lightly floured rolling pin or your hands, roll or pat the dough about 1/2 inch thick.
Lightly flour a 2- to 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and cut the biscuits, leaving as little space between each cut as possible and pressing down just once for each biscuit; do not twist the cutter.
If the dough begins to stick to the cutter, dip the cutter in a little flour.
Gather the excess biscuit dough, reroll once, and cut as many biscuits from it as possible.
Arrange the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet.
Brush the tops with cream, sprinkle with sugar, and bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
While the biscuits are baking, combine the strawberries and remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar in a bowl and mash lightly with a fork or your hand to release some of the juices.
Remove the biscuits from the oven, split in half, and place a pat of butter in the middle, allowing the butter to melt.
Spoon the strawberries over and serve warm.
If you dont have self-rising flour in your pantry, you can still avoid a trip to the store by making your own.
Add 2 teaspoons baking powder or 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder plus 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to every 3 cups of all-purpose flour.
If the recipe does not call for salt, add 1/2 teaspoon to the mix as well.



Preheat the oven to 200C (190C is fine, depending on the oven).
Combine the ingredients in a bowl using a whisk.
Add the yogurt, and mix with a spoon.
Bring the dough together by hand, and press it down until it's about 2 cm thick.
Cut into 5-6 portions using a knife or dough scraper, and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the oven for 15-17 minutes at 190C, and it's done.
It's crispy on the outside and moist on the inside thanks to the yogurt.
Done.
It puffed up 2-3 times its height.
It looks like this when you break it apart.
Serve with jam or whipped cream for a fancy snack.

Sift all dry ingredients together until well mixed.
Cut or mix fat into flour mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture esembels coarse cornmeal.
Store the pre-made mix in a jar or can with a tight lid.
It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or jars where it will be ready for use.
It may be stored at room temperature for 6 weeks.
Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are already in the mix so more milk is not need.
You can use fruit juice, water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.
Add water to mix and stir 20 to 25 times.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 to 15 times.
Roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes or use biscuit cutter to make circles.
Place in preheated 400 degree F oven and bake 5 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve warm biscuits with butter or jam if desired.



Place corn and oil in a 3 quart saucepan.
I use paper towel, wide enough to cover the pan and a splatter screen over the paper towel to cover my pot.
This lets the steam escape and controls splattering from the oil.
Heat oil and one or two kernels.
When kernels pop, add remaining corn, remove from heat and count to thirty.
I count one one thousand, two one thousand, etc.
Place pan back on hob.
When popping slows to almost nothing, it's ready.
Pax.

Pour in festive glass -- top with whipped cream -- mistakenly think you are at Applebees and wonder why nobody is bussing your table.



Equipment: A wooden spoon, a large stainless pot (5 liters), a pastry brush, and a small ramekin of extra water.
Have all your ingredients and equipment ready before beginning the cooking process.
This goes quickly, so you need to be ready.
Add the sugar and listed amount of water to your pot.
Cook over medium to medium-high heat until the sugar begins to boil.
Use your pastry brush dipped in the extra water to clean any sugar crystals from the side of the pot.
Do not stir it!
Let the sugar boil and change color.
Gently swirl your pan to stir, but only very occasionally.
Once the sugar turns a golden amber color, remove from heat.
Immediately stir in your cream with a wooden spoon.
The mixture will bubble violently, so be careful!
This is also why we use a large pot.
Stir in the butter, salt, and vanilla next.
The caramel will be a little thin, but thickens upon standing.
If the sugar seizes at all when the cream is added, you can return the pot to medium heat and continue stirring until all the sugar dissolves.
Cool the caramel sauce to room temperature, and then refrigerate up to two weeks.



Grease 2 large baking pans; set aside.
Heat oil in large saucepan over high heat until hot.

Remove from heat and stir in the margarine.



Combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan.
This is the only time you can stir the sugar.
If you stir it while it's cooking, it turns to rock candy.
Place the saucepan over medium to low heat until the sugars start to dissolve, 5 to 10 minutes.
Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook until the sugar starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes.
Do not stir while this is happening.
You've got to watch the pot, because it goes from caramel to burnt really quickly.
And be careful, the mixture is extremely hot!
Turn off the heat and stand back to avoid splattering.
Slowly add the cream.
Don't panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify.
Just give it more time to liquefy again-trust me!
Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes.
Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours.
It will thicken as it sits.



Combine all ingredients in a jar.
Shake until blended.
Pour over salad.
Store the rest in the fridge.



In mixer bowl, mix first 4 ingredients.

Add the vodka, cover with a lid, and let steep for about 2 months in a cool, dark place.
Stir every few weeks.
Line a large strainer with a triple layer of dampened cheesecloth and set it over a bowl.
Strain the mixture through it.
Bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to make a bag.
Twist the ends and squeeze to extract as much liquid as possible.
Discard the pulp.
Wash the jar and return the liquid to it.
Let stand for about 2 hours.
If there is sediment at the bottom of the jar, pour off all the clear liquid into a clean container and filter the remaining cloudy liquid through a coffee filter, changing the filter occasionally to speed up the filtering process.
Combine the sugar and the water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.
Boil, stirring, for 2 minutes, until the sugar is dissolved.
Allow to cool to room temperature.
Add about 1 3/4 cups of the sugar syrup to the liqueur and taste.
If necessary, add more, about a 1/4 cup at a time, until you arrive at a satisfactory sweetness.
The amount of sugar syrup will depend on your taste buds and the sweetness of the raspberries.
I like it less sweet, so this step is important to me.
Pour the liqueur into clean, dry bottles, and cork them.
Drink within a year before the color and flavor fade.
Best stored in a cool, dark place.
(I like to wax my bottles.
Get a clean tin can and put in a small pan of boiling water, then add about 1/4 block of household paraffin wax.
Turn off the heat.
Add a colored crayon or two, broken into pieces, and stir with a plastic spoon or a popsicle stick, until everything is melted.
Place everything on several thicknesses of newspaper.
Check the color of your wax on the newspaper, add more crayons if needed to get the color you want.
Immerse the top of the firmly corked bottle so that the wax covers the first 2 inches, remove it and allow to cool for a few seconds, then dip it several more times, always allowing it to cool between coatings, until you can no longer see the cork through the wax.
Let wax set until firm.
(Sometimes I sprinkle glitter into the outside layers of the wax, it adds an even more festive touch!).
Then add a homemade label, ribbons, rafia, whatever!



In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, hot water, and vanilla and whisk briskly.
If the glaze is too thick, add warm water one tablespoon at a time until the icing reaches a thick yet slightly runny consistency.

The glaze can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.



Sift the flour and salt together into a mixing bowl and set aside.
Beat the butter in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment at high speed until it is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add the brown sugar, crumbling it with your hands as you add it to get rid of any lumps.
Mix on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula halfway through mixing to ensure that the butter and sugar are well mixed.
Add the vanilla and mix until combined.
Again, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure that the ingredients are incorporated.
Add approximately half the flour mixture and mix on low speed just until the flour is incorporated, about 30 seconds.
Add the milk and peanut butter and mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds.
Then add the remaining flour and mix until just combined.
Remove the dough from the bowl, press it into a flat mound, and wrap it in plastic wrap.
Let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
While the dough is chilling, preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper or spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.
Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and scoop or roll it into balls about 1 tablespoon in size.
Place the balls of dough about 1 inch apart on the prepared pans.
Using your thumb or the back of a teaspoon measure, gently press the center of each dough ball to make an indentation in the top of each cookie.
Chill the cookie dough on the sheets in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans once halfway through, until the edges of the cookies are golden brown.
Remove the cookies from the oven, let them cool slightly on the pans, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
While the cookies are cooling, prepare the ganache filling.
Combine the milk chocolate chips, corn syrup, vanilla, and heavy cream in a mixing bowl and heat over a double boiler.
Stir constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the chocolate is fully melted and the ingredients have completely combined.
Once the chocolate mixture is smooth, take the bowl off the heat and add the peanut butter, stirring vigorously until combined.
Spoon the ganache filling into the indentations on each of the cookies.
Let the ganache set at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Serve the cooled cookies immediately, or keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
Instead of using ganache, substitute 1/2 teaspoon of raspberry jam per cookie and fill the thumbprint of each cookie prior to baking.
Bake as directed.

When the oatmeal is at a consistency you like, pour it into a bowl and top with the melted jam and chopped peanuts.
Remember, this is oatmeal and you can make it anyway you want.
Prefer almond butter?
Go for it!
Want maple syrup instead of honey?
Do it!
Make it your own.
Oh, and if you think you added to much liquid and cant seem to get a thick enough consistency, leave the lid off the pot and it will evaporate instead of the oats having to absorb it.

).
Remove the bread when baked and cool on a cooling rack.
Serve warm with butter, cheese, jam, hams and cold cuts, or slice when cool for sandwiches.
Also wonderful when toasted the next day.

Put the case for your bread maker on a scale and pour in the milk.
Measure out the other ingredients and add them in.
Set the dough either on the soft bread or golden brown setting, and let it make the dough.
You can also make a low fat version.
The bread will brown easily (especially with the chocolate version), so use the Sweet Bread setting if your machine has it.
If you don't take it out quickly, it will burn and become hard!
If the crust and top burn too much, try taking the bread out 5 to 8 minutes before the baking course ends.
Once it has cooled down, store in a bag so it doesn't dry out.
If possible, slice the bread when you need it.
Don't slice it all in the beginning.
Marble Chocolate Version: At the mix call, add in 8 pieces of chocolate.
According to the kind of chocolate bar and the timing, it might turn out as chocolate bread.
I suppose it depends on your machine!
Chocolate Sandwich Bread Substitute 20-30 of the 250 g of bread flour with cocoa powder.
You can also use matcha, etc.
Cheese Sandwich Bread Add in 1-4 slices of cheese.
You can either do this at the mix call or at the beginning.
The dough will rise really high!
You can also add in cubed cheese at the end.
Hot Sandwiches Chocolate Banana Cheese Sandwiches are the best!
For a healthier version: Substitute soy milk for the milk, the sweetener for the sugar, reduce the salt to 2 g, and use 15 g of transfat free shortening for the grease.
Flour 270 g: Milk 220 g, Bread flour 270 g, Sugar 32 g, Yeast 3.2 g, Salt 3.2 g, Butter 21 g.
Flour 300 g: Milk 250 g, Bread flour 300 g, Sugar 36 g, Yeast 3.6 g, Salt 3.6 g, Butter 24 g.
Flour 350 g: Milk 290 g, Bread flour 350 g, Sugar 42 g, Yeast 4.2 g, Salt 4.2 g, Butter 28 g.
is the Forever Fluffy Shaped Bread.
Lately I have been using a new Bread Machine.
With the regular course, the dough rises too fast, creates a depression, and bakes too fast.
Maybe I was putting in 38 g of sugar?
Instead of salt, you can use 18 grams of shio-koji!
It's stays fluffy, and it seems like it's even a bit sweeter this way.
This is something that's been a big hit lately.
I've been using 100% veggie juice!!
Half veggie juice and half soy milk is also just as good.
I love it.

Heat waffle iron and spray with cooking spray.
In a bowl, combine pancake mix, sugar and cocoa.
Stir in water and oil.
Batter will be slightly lumpy.
Pour 1/3 cup batter into each waffle space.
Bake for 5 minutes or until steaming stops and waffles are golden brown.



Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Put oil onto a paper towel and wipe down a cookie sheet with rims with the oiled cloth.
This should be just enough to coat the pan to prevent the tofu from sticking.
Drain the tofu, then wrap and press gently with paper towels or a cloth towel to get out the excess liquid.
Do not press too hard.
Cut the blocks of tofu into 1/2 inch squares (or whatever shape you want).
I usually cut 4 rows across and 4 down, then I take each piece and cut horizontally - almost like butterflying the cube, but slicing all the way through.
Place on cookie sheet close together but not touching.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, turning pieces over halfway through cooking time.



You want to start with berries that are either frozen then partially thawed, or fresh and then about half frozen.
Either way works!
In your blender, blend the strawberries, 1/2 to 1 cup coconut water, and 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons agave [or honey], adding the agave or honey last [to avoid sticking at the bottom], and using the smallest amount of coconut water possible to reach a smooth consistency.
You want the mixture as thick as possible for all of the layers.
Empty into a bowl or glass and freeze for about 30 minutes until starting to thicken.
Proceed with the rest of the recipe.
Rinse your blender then blend the blackberries, blueberries, 1/2 to 1 cup coconut water, and 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons agave [or honey], adding the agave or honey last [to avoid sticking at the bottom], and using the smallest amount of coconut water possible to reach a smooth consistency.
Place in a bowl in the freezer for about 30 minutes until starting to thicken.
Rinse your blender then blend the crushed ice, lime juice, lime zest, 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons agave [or honey], adding the agave or honey last [to avoid sticking at the bottom], and using the smallest amount of coconut water possible to reach a smooth consistency.
Taste and add more sweetener if desired.
Place in a bowl in the freezer for about 30 minutes until starting to thicken.
After all mixtures have thickened [You are trying to reach a texture where you can spoon the layers on top of one another without them mixing.
Like a thick slushy.
However, if they mix it's completely fine!]
spoon the strawberry mixture into your popsicle molds first about 1/3 of the way up.
Tap on the counter to level.
Spoon in the lime mixture next making sure there are no air pockets [lightly poke with the top end of the spoon to help fill gaps], then top with the blackberry/blueberry layer and level off the top.
Place popsicle sticks in the ends [should be thick enough that they remain standing] and freeze until solid, about 4 to 5 hours.
Serve once frozen.
You may need to allow the pops to thaw for about 5 to 10 minutes before being able to remove them from the molds.



Place fruit in a 8x8 inch pan.
Combine flour, sugar and cinnamon.
Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly and moist; sprinkle over fruit.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes or until topping is crisp and golden.

In a mixer bowl with the dough hook (or in my case a food processor with a dough blade), pour in flour, oil, salt and garlic salt.
Beat until crumbly.
With mixer running, gradually add warm water and continue mixing until the dough is smooth.
Take out the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces; I cut each piece in half until I have 12 pieces.
Roll each piece into a ball and flatten it out on a cutting board/tray.
Cover them with plastic wrap for about 15 to 30 minutes at room temperature.
Heat a skillet/griddle over medium-high heat.
On a lightly floured board, use a rolling pin to turn each circle into a nice flat tortilla.
Add a bit of oil to the pan if needed (I dont use oil on my nonstick pan), and then cook each tortilla one by one about 30 seconds on each side (it will puff up).
Set aside on a plate to enjoy right away or refrigerate and freeze for later.
I like making rolled chicken tacos with mine.

Sift the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Sprinkle the pieces of lard and butter over them and place the bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Dust your work surface with flour.
If prebaking, preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut the lard and butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, with a scattering of pea-sized pieces throughout.
Add ice water a tablespoon at a time, and toss with a fork to combine after each addition, until the pastry holds together when pinched (you may not use all the ice water).
Gather the pastry together into a round disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes or until ready to use.
With a floured pin, roll out the dough on the floured surface to a 12-inch round.
To make a pie shell, transfer to a 9-inch pie pan.
Fold any excess dough that hangs below the rim of the pan on top of the rim so you have enough material to crimp.
Cut off any egregious excess and use it to patch any holes or tears.
Refrigerate for 15 minutes before filling or prebaking.
To prebake the crust for our Sweet Potato Buttermilk Pie, lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the dough and carefully scatter pie weights, dried beans, or pennies in the pan.
Bake on the middle rack for 12 to 15 minutes.
Remove the pie weights and the foil, prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, and bake for 10 minutes more, or until the bottom of the crust appears dry.



Mix all ingredients and serve either hot or cold.
Sprinkle with cinnamon.



Preheat oven to 450F.

SOFTLY AND GENTLY mix with a spoon and incorporating all the ingredients together until everything is mixed.
bake for about 15-20 minutes until the bottoms are browned (but not burnt) and they look done.
(I have a convection oven so times may vary).
Note: DO NOT OVER MIX, however do not undermix.
I do not know the outcome that this may have, but I have a feeling that it isn't very good!

Then mix in the rest of the ingredients.
Mix in the flour without kneading, using a large wooden spoon.
Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature for about 2 hours.
You can use the dough at this point, or refrigerate and use over next 12 days.
If you refrigerate at least overnight, you'll develop better flavor in the dough.
If you only want to make 1 flatbread, just pinch off a grapefruit sized piece of dough to use -- keep the remaining covered loosely in the refrigerator.
You can freeze the dough as well -- but I haven't tried it, because honestly, it's so good that the dough never goes unbaked for more than 4 days.
This is enough dough for 4 large pizzas.
Use as you would with any pizza recipe.

Then add some sugar (just until the raspberries have a light coating about 1 teaspoon per handful).
Then stir as it heats up (if you would like you could add a teaspoon of water to help the process along)..
Boil down until its thickened and bubbly.
What I do at this point is strain the syrup because I dont like alot of seeds.
If you would like a thin pretty syrup use just the juice OR if you want it to be more like a warm jam add a few spoonfuls of the seeds back into the syrup when it has finished draining.

Use a pan that doesn't easily burn.
Put the ingredients in the pan, and warm it up until the sugar has dissolved while mixing.
Make sure to not let it come to a boil.
Turn the heat off, add the dried shiro-an powder, and mix well to dissolve.
The powder forms clumps easily so be sure to mash them.
Turn the heat on to a low setting, and stir and knead the paste until it reaches your desired consistency.
It burns easily, so keep stirring consistency and work fast.
The paste will keep stiffening up with residual heat, so take the pan off the heat as soon as you're done.
The paste will also become stiffer when it cools, so stop cooking it when it's a bit more liquid than you want.
Cover the paste with plastic wrap so that it doesn't dry out.
You can adjust the consistency depending on what you are going to use the paste for, but it tastes best when it's soft and creamy.
When the paste falls slowly from a spoon when scooped up as shown here, it was delicious spread on toast.
This is a bonus but...
I wanted to make it really milky flavored, so I tried using just condensed milk to sweeten the paste.
The next day the paste was like very hard clay!
Next, I tried adding sweetness with white chocolate and condensed milk.
The paste became very soft, but the sweetness was cloying...
This time I tried adding condensed milk and sugar in equal amounts.
The texture was moist and creamy and really nice!
The moisture retaining powers of sugar are awesome!
But!
It was too sweet...
So, I took the middle road and used the amounts listed in this recipe, and it was just right.
You do need sugar, even if it's a small amount.
It was a learning experience!

Notes: They make round tortilla warmers like foam coolers that are usually less than$3, but any covered dish will do.
You may need more flour than usual on your surface because these tortillas are slightly more soft which makes them easier to roll but also sticky if you don't use enough flour.
I place a paper towel or cloth in the bottom of the warmer before I start adding the tortillas to prevent the bottom one from getting soggy from steam.
If you like the fluffy tortillas like on a muchaco or gordita (sp?)
at chain resturaunts you can add baking powder to this and make circles slightly smaller.
They can also be deep fried into taco shell shapes after they are grilled.

Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they are golden.
Remove the tray from the oven.
You'll need to shape your soft warm biscuits into a concave shape.
To do this, get out your muffin pan.
Carefully lift a dozen of these warm biscuits and place over the mouth of each well in the muffin tray and gently push down to create the desired shape.
Don't worry if some of the biscuits split a little - just push them back together.
As they cool, the biscuits will harden and fuse.
Gently tip the formed and cooled biscuits out of the muffin tin and place on a wire rack ready for filling.
To make the filling: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan with high sides, heat the sugar until the sugar crystals dissolve, the mixture boils and it starts to take on a dark golden hue.
Do not stir the sugar once it has started to boil.
Once that state has been reached, carefully whisk in the butter with the pan on the heat.
Beware now as the mixture will froth, so make sure that you've followed the instructions about a high-sided pan.
When the butter has melted, remove from the heat, take a big deep breath and then pour in the cream.
Another warning: It will froth again.
Gently stir with a metal whisk to combine.

Recipe adapted from Foodie with a Family.



1.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small mixing bowl.
(Note that you could also use 1 cup of self-rising flour instead of this mixture.)
And feel free to go lighter on the salta biscuit made with less salt and served with a creamy, salty butter is delicious!
2.
Add cheese to the flour mixture.
Depending on what Im serving the biscuits with, sometimes I like to add a bit more cheese for extra flavor.
And feel free to be flexible with the type of cheese you use.
My favorite is a super-aged cheddar!
3.
Stir milk and mayonnaise into the mixture, just until moistened.
4.
Fill 6 greased muffin cups 2/3 full.
5.
Bake at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until biscuit tops are golden brown.

Reduce the heat to med-low and simmer until the cider is reduced to 1 c, about 30 minute Transfer the cider, ginger and butter to the food processor with the potatoes and process until very smooth.



Preheat the oven to 350F.
Grease two baking sheets.
Beat together the butter and the 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer, at medium speed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add the vanilla, salt, and pecans and beat until combined.
Remove the mixing bowl from the mixer and mix in the flour, using a wooden spoon.
Do not overmix.
Form the dough into crescent shapes and place on the baking sheets.
Bake for 12 minutes or until the edges and bottoms are golden brown.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
Meanwhile, put the I cup of confectioners sugar in a large bowl.
When the cookies are cool enough to handle, put a few at a time in the bowl and shake to coat with the sugar.
Remove and continue until all the cookies are coated.
Then sift confectioners sugar over each to give them a second sugar coating.



Mix together and shape into balls or crescents or rings.
Make about 36 cookies.
Bake 10 to 15 minutes at 325F (160C).



Roll or grind the breakfast cereal.
There should be 1 1/2 cups after crushing.
Combine with the melted butter, sugar (if using), and cinnamon.
An easy way to form the crust is after mixing to press another pie pan of the same diameter firmly into the dough.
When the top pan is removed a crust of even thickness is underneath.
Trim any excess that is forced to the top edge.
Crumb crusts need not be baked before filling, but if used unbaked, must be first chilled thoroughly or the filling will immediately disintegrate the crust.
If baked before filling, they require a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.
It is best to cool the empty baked shell before filling.
Fill a prebaked shell with chiffon fillings, bavarian creams, or gelatin whips topped with sweetened whipped cream, or with custard or fruit filling, which may be covered with a high meringue.



Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine all seasonings in a large ziploc bag -- shake to mix.
Melt butter in a large saucepan.
Add small quanity of wings to butter, stir to coat.
Use tongs to remove wings, place in ziploc bag.
Seal and shake.
Place on foil covered baking sheet (use two sheets, usually I'll do one sheet with drizzle one without out)
Continue with remainder of wings.
With left-over butter, drizzle over top wings.
Bake for approx 45 min depending on oven/size of wings.



Mix flour, brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl.

Place the apples in a slow cooker, stir in the cornstarch mixture; toss with lemon juice.
Sprinkle the walnut crumb topping on top.
Cover and cook on High for 2 hours or Low for 4 hours, until apples are tender.
Partially uncover the slow cooker to allow the topping to harden, about 1 hour.



Line the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper and then lightly spray with cooking spray.
In a small saucepan, combine the cream, butter and salt to a boil and then remove from the heat.
Set aside.

Bring to a boil while continuing to stir until all the sugar is dissolved.
Continue to boil without stirring but swirling the pan gently until the mixture is a light golden color.
Stir in the cream mixture slowly (the mixture will bubble violently) and simmer over low heat stirring frequently until the caramel reaches 248 degrees F, or soft ball stage, on a candy thermometer, approximately 15 minutes.
Pour the caramel into the prepared baking pan and cool completely.
Cut the caramel into one inch squares and sprinkle the tops with sea salt flakes.
Wrap each caramel individually in a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper.
Note: I poured my mixture onto a baking sheet and cut the cooled caramel into 1/2-inch ribbons.
I then rolled each ribbon into the pinwheel shape you see in the picture.
The squares are much easier because as you handle the caramel it will begin to warm up and become difficult to deal with.

Pour the milk into a large casserole.
Add the yogurt.
The closer is the yogurt to the expiration date, the better.
The milk should be relatively fresh though.
Mix and leave under a cheesecloth (so that it breathes) for about 48 hours.
If the temperature in your house drops to 60F overnight, warm the casserole in the evening on slowest possible heat for about 10-15 minutes.
After 48 hours (possibly up to 72) the milk will have kefir's consistency and smell.
Put the casserole on the slowest possible heat for about 60-75 minutes.
The contents of the casserole should warm up to 140F but not higher.
At this stage a white lump should separate itself completely from a clean liquid.
Drain the liquid.
You may preserve it (this is milk whey) to use in breads and pancakes.
Tie the lump in a cheesecloth, put it on a strainer, put the strainer to hang over the empty casserole and put a small lid with a weight over the cheesecloth for the complete draining.
Put the casserole with all the stuff into the refrigerator for 8-12 hours.
The longer you keep it there the drier it gets (personal preference matters).

Place the applesauce, apricots, and sugar into a non-reactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.
Mix together, then add the raspberries.
The raspberries will dominate the flavor.
If you want apricot-flavored Pate de Fruit, omit the raspberries.
Using a hand-held immersion blender or whisk, combine all of the ingredients until smooth and homogenous.
As the mixture cooks, the natural pectin in the fruit will cause the mixture to thicken.
Continue to cook until it is thick, mixing constantly.
To test for the correct consistency, dip a whisk in the mixture and hold horizontally in front of you.
Watch as the mixture drips off the whisk and back into the pan.
If the mixture stays on the whisk and beads up into small balls, like pearls, it is ready.
If it drips back into the pan in thin strands, it needs to be cooked a little longer.
When the mixture is a bit thicker than jam, pour it into a spouted container.
Fill either a half-dome or triangle shaped flexipan, depending on the desired design of the jewels and let rest for 4 hours at room temperature.
When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar.
If you do not have a flexipan, you can pour the Pate de Fruit into a 10-inch bottomless tart mold or cake ring placed on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet.
Let the Pate de Fruit cool and set, about 3 hours at room temperature.
When the mixture has set, remove and roll each jewel in sugar.
To unmold, run a sharp paring knife between the fruit and the mold and lift off the mold.
(At this point the Pate de Fruit can be stored, well wrapped in plastic and in an airtight container, for up to 2 months.)
Sprinkle the top of the Pate de Fruit with a thin layer of sugar and flip it onto another sheet of parchment paper.
Remove the parchment that is now on top.
Sprinkle this side with more sugar.
Using a wet chef's knife or cutter, cut the Pate de Fruit into any shapes.
Roll each piece completely in sugar and serve.
Do not store in the refrigerator, as the humidity will make the sugar melt.

Sprinkle the chicken lightly with seasoning.
Rub into skin for best flavor.
Place on baking pan and bake at 325F for 1 to 1 1/2 hrs until chicken is done.
Allow to sit for 20 minutes to rest, then serve.
If you have the time roast at a lower temperature for a longer time.
5 hours at 250 degrees F would be reasonable starting point.
Use an instant read thermometer to be certain to cook to a safe internal temperature, at that temperature for that time it's likely the meat will simply be fall off the bone tender and juicy.



Put the water in a pan, bring to a boil, add the sugar, and stir constantly for about 30 seconds or until the sugar has dissolved.
To prevent the syrup from crystallizing, it is important that it completely dissolves.

Put 1/4 cup of the ale and the sugar in a saucepan and stir over low heat until the sugar is fully dissolved.
Add the remaining ale and warm until you can see the alcohols vapors being released from the surface.
The ale needs only to be warm enough to melt the chocolate overheating it will cook off the alcohol which is the natural preservative in this ganache.
Pour the ale into a blender and add the chocolate gradually on medium speed until smooth.
Cool for 30 minutes and pipe into shells, or leave to set in the fridge, then hand roll into truffles.
Use the tempered chocolate for coating.

Cream the butter and brown sugar.
In a separate bowl, sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cocoa powder and salt.
Add these sifted ingredients and the syrup to the butter mixture and combine until a dough forms.
Bring it together with your hands, then divide it into four equal pieces.
Roll each piece into a long sausage shape about 2.5 cm in diameter.
Preheat the oven to 170 degrees C/Mark 3 and line two baking trays with non-stick baking paper.
Place a sausage of dough between two sheets of cling film (I prefer not to use flour because it marks the surface of the biscuits) and roll out to about 3mmthick.
Chill in the fridge whilst you repeat this process with the remaining dough.
Transfer the chilled pastry to a chopping board and use a pizza wheel or sharp knife to straighten the edges.
When you have a neat shape, slice each piece into eight `fingers'.
Traditional bourbon biscuits measure 6 x 3 cm, so if you want to create the perfect size, cut the fingers slightly smaller than this as they spread a little in the oven.
Using a palette knife, lift the biscuits onto the prepared trays, spacing them at least 2 cm apart.
Now use a fine skewer to make shallow holes along the top of each biscuit - two rows of five if you're a bourbon perfectionist.
Bake for 10 minutes, until the biscuits look dry on top, then carefully check one with a palette knife.
Sprinkle with granulated sugar and press it in gently with the back of a spoon.
If ready, it will be fragile but should lift cleanly and neatly away from the lining paper.
If not, bake for a few more minutes, then check again.
When the biscuits are done, leave them on the trays for about 15 minutes, then use a palette knife to transfer them carefully to a wire rack.
They will harden as they cool.
To make the filling, sift the icing sugar and cocoa into a bowl.
(It is so tempting to miss out this step, but sifting is essential if you want a smooth butter cream.)
Add the butter, vanilla and boiling water and beat well with a fork or hand mixer until smooth and creamy.
Keep the butter cream at room temperature until you are ready to fill the biscuits.
When the biscuits are completely cold, use a palette knife to spread the filling onto the underside side of one biscuit and gently press another biscuit on top.
Sandwich all the biscuits in this way.



In a medium pot, bring the cream, milk, and buttermilk to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
Simmer gently for a few minutes until the milk solids rise to the surface and form what looks like a raft.
Shut off the heat and allow the milk to rest and cool gently on the stove, 15 to 20 minutes.
Line a strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth.
Use a large spoon to scoop the solids from the surface into the strainer.
Pour the liquid gently over the solids in the strainer, allowing the liquid to flow through the strainer and trapping the solids in the cheesecloth.
The liquid is the whey and can be used to thicken soups or as a substitute for water in bread dough, among other things.
Refrigerate for a few hours to allow all of the liquid to drain out and the ricotta to firm up slightly.
Use the ricotta as desired.

In a small pot, bring water to a boil.
Place a small plate in the freezer to check consistency of jam.
Remove 3 cups of the berries and place in a sieve with a pestle to remove the seeds.
Smash until juice has been removed.
Alternately, you could smash the 3 cups berries with a potato masher and run that through a fine strainer to remove seeds, or if you like the seeds, smash the fruit well with the potato masher and use like you would the 3 cups berries with seeds removed.
Do not blend your berries, it will destroy the natural pectin.
Place the juice from the berries into a large stock pot and add all of the sugar.
Mix together and bring to a boil over medium heat.
Once the mixture boils, add remaining 4 cups of berries and smash half or more with a potato masher, depending on how chunky you like your jam.
The more berries you smash, the smoother the jam.
Return berries to a boil and cook for about 13 minutes.
Jam is about done when foaming has subsided and jam becomes a rich glossy red color.
Take the plate from the freezer and place a large dollop of jam on the plate and place back into the freezer for 1 minute.
After a minute, run a finger through the jam.
Jam is ready to be canned when juices from the berries stay separated and dont run.
Jam will still be a bit thin but not runny.
If jam is still runny, continue to cook checking every minute for set with plate from the freezer.
In the small pot with boiling water, remove from heat and add lids.
Remove a jar from the canner and place on a clean work surface.

This should keep for about 5 days.
It may seperate upon refrigeration, so in this even, just mix it back together with a fork before serving.
Mine has sort of a brownish-tint (perhaps from the soy sauce), and I wouldn't necessarily try and pass this off as real sour cream on your hubby's baked potato, but if you want it for a recipe (not sure about baked goods) this should be okay.

NOTE: SOME FIVE-SPICE RECIPES WILL HAVE YOU TOAST THE WHOLE FENNEL AND STAR ANISE FIRST.
YOU MAY DO THIS, BUT I GENERALLY PREFER NOT TO FOR A CLEAN, FRESH FLAVOR.
HOWEVER, IF USING THE SPICE SPECIFICALLY FOR BARBECUED MEATS OR PHO SOUP, I RECOMMEND LIGHTLY TOASTING THEM FIRST IN A DRY SKILLET OVER MEDIUM HEAT FOR A SMOKY FLAVOR BEFORE THE FINAL GRINDING.
YOU MAY SUBSTITUTE THE SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN WITH WHITE PEPPER, WHICH IS A POPULAR BLEND FOR USE IN CHINESE COOKERY.
KEEP IN MIND -- "A LITTLE BIT OF FIVE SPICE POWDER GOES A LONG WAY".
WHEN SEASONING FOODS, START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT, THEN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.
MEASURE all ingredients into a clean spice mill or coffee grinder, whether whole or ground, using pre-ground cinnamon as the only exception: 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon fennel, 1 tablespoon star anise, 1 tablespoon Szechuan peppercorn.
GRIND mixture in a clean spice mill or coffee grinder in 15-30 second increments, until mixture is finely powderized.
Store in an airtight container.
Use measure-for-measure in any recipe calling for Chinese Five Spice powder.



Combine strawberries, water, honey, and lemon juice in a blender.
Mix until well blended.
Pour mixture into an 8x4x2 inch pan.

When the mixture is semi-solid in the center, transfer it into a food processor and process until smooth.
Dump into an airtight container, stir in the chocolate chips, and freeze until serving time.

In a 1-quart, heat proof, microwavable measuring bowl, mix all of the ingredients.
Heat in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes or until the butter is completely melted.
Stir and heat until mixture is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes.
Let stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes until slightly thickened.
Hints for success: - Be sure to heat the griddle before pouring your pancake batter.
- Using a copper bowl to whisk the egg whites will give you more volume.
- Do not whisk the whites until they appear dry.
They should be stiff, yet moist.
- Fold the whites and the squash mixture gently.
If you over do it you will deflate the whites and have tougher, flatter pancakes.
- The syrup is rich and full of flavor.
You can make it the night before, refrigerate it and reheat the next morning.
- Use the freshest apple cider you can find.
If you use apple juice, try to use one that is not overly sweet.

If you dont have one, adjust accordingly.)
Combine water, yeast and honey in mixer bowl and mix until just combined.
Put the lid on and let it sit for 10 minutes or so, until it gets frothy.
Then add the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and mix until it just comes together and then check the dough for consistency if its very sticky, add a little flour, if its dry add a little lukewarm water.
The dough should feel just slightly sticky.
Once the dough is the right consistency, mix on medium speed for about 8 minutes, then turn the dough out into a large oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for about an hour.
I put my bowl next to the coffee maker to keep warm.
After the dough has risen, punch it down and form into loaves or rolls or both, like I do.
I roll mine out for loaves and put into a greased 9x5 loaf pan, and for rolls I follow PWs lead and put rolls, evenly spaced, into a buttered 12 cast-iron skillet.
Let rise again, about 30 45 minutes, depending on how warm it is where theyre rising.

Place the lid on the jar, and give it a few vigorous shakes to make sure everything is well mixed.
Place the pudding in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, or overnight if you like it thicker.
Shake the jar occasionally to ensure everything stays mixed while it cooks.
Spoon into serving dishes, add your fruit of choice, and any other toppings you like (such as nuts, coconut, or dark chocolate shavings, and perhaps a dollop of fat-free whipped cream).
Enjoy!
* If you prefer, you can give the whole mixture a whirl in the blender.
This will grind the seeds up a little and result in a smoother pudding.

Place all the ingredients into the bread machine according to manufacturer's directions.
Bake using french bread cycle if your machine has it.
If not, use the dark crust white cycle.
Start with 2 3/4 cups flour, you might need more depending on a lot of factors.
My favorite way to get the texture I like is about 10 minutes into the knead cycle I will pinch a good size chunk of dough between my thumb and two or three fingers.
If it feels just moist and some dough sticks to my fingers, it's just right.
If no dough sticks, it's a bit dry and add a few teaspoons of water.
If it feels too soft and very sticky, add more flour until you get the right consistency after about another 5 minutes of kneading.



Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, stirring until melted and smooth and cool slightly.
Stir in the corn syrup (chocolate will stiffen almost immediately) until completely combined.
Transfer chocolate to a plastic freezer bag and refrigerate until firm (about two hours).
When the paste is firm, remove from the refrigerator, and knead it until it is soft enough to work with.
Tip: If it is too hard, cut off small pieces, and knead until pliable and grease the counter where you are working with oil or spray with Pam so the chocolate won't stick.
You can make the chocolate into whatever shape you want- it can be formed into a long rope/braid and wrapped around the base of the cake, or made into flowers, leaves, or any other decorations.
Another example is to pat the dough into a disk shape between plastic wrap or parchment and roll it out to desired thickness using a rolling pin, then cut into desired shapes or strips.
It will keep for months, wrapped properly (if it gets hard to work with knead in a little more corn syrup until it is pliable again).
Semi-Sweet Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 3 1/2- 4 TB light corn syrup.
White Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces (200 grams) white chocolate, chopped and 1 1/2- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup.
Milk Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces Milk Chocolate and 2 1/2- 3 tablespoons light corn syrup.

Keep each ball on a wax paper and let it rise for another 30 minutes.
You can place these balls on individual pieces of wax paper so you can use these to place in the steamer too for easier handling.
Bring water in the bottom of a steamer to a boil first.
Then place the rolls in the steamer, leaving a 1-inch gap between them.
Cook in batches if need be.
Cook them for 10-15 minutes, or until they are firm and cooked through.
Do not turn the heat off before you lift the lid of the steamer as this causes blistering on the surface of the rolls.
Serve them hot.

No sticking!



Sift the flour then measure.
Add b. powder and salt and sift again.
Cut in the butter.
Hyde recommends using your fingers for this by rubbing the butter into the flour.
I usually don't because the heat of my hands and fingers tend to melt the butter and that's not good.
If you have "hot hands" too, use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the butter into the flour.
Add the milk gradually, stirring gently.
Add only enough milk to bring the flour together in a soft ball.
Turn the mix onto a floured surface and knead it reluctantly, just enough to incorporate all the milk.
Gently pat the dough into a 1/2" tall layer.
Handle the dough as little possible so the biscuits will be tender.
Cut the dough into rounds or squares and place in a buttered pan.
It helps biscuits to rise more if you allow the sides to touch.
I don't know why this works but it usually does for me.
Bake for 12 - 15 minutes at 400 deg.
You can make these into great appetizers by adding shredded cheddar and fresh parsley to the flour before adding milk.
Then cut the biscuits with a small cutter (or glass) about 2" in diameter.

Gently rinse the white rice in a colander or sieve so that the rice doesn't soak in the water and absorb any of the cloudy water.
Let the drained sit in the colander for 1 hour.
Once the water has been thoroughly drained from the rice in Step 1, put it into the Staub pot and add the water.
*If the rice was left to sit for 1 hour it will soak up the water very nicely.
You've now completed all the preliminaries to cook delicious rice.
Place the pot on the stove after the rice has been soaked for an hour, and set the heat to medium.
Medium heat as specified in Step 3 should be strong enough so that the flames touch the bottom of the pot.
The photo shows a round 16cm Staube cocotte with 1.5 rice cooker cups of rice.
Once the water in the pot begins to bubble at the bottom, and the center becomes cloudy, raise the heat to high.
The flames should never be so strong that they escape around the edges of the pot.
Turning the heat up to high in Step 5 will get the edges of the water to start boiling.
The center will become even more cloudy.
Once big bubbles start forming, it's almost done.
When even more big bubbles start forming, cover the pot with a lid.
Set a timer to 1 minute.
Occasionally some soapy bubbles may escape from underneath the lid (once or twice), but don't worry about it.
*The photo shows the marks left by the sticky bubbles.
After 1 minute is up, turn down the heat to low (turn the burner knob to the lowest setting).
Set the timer for 9 minutes.
After 9 minutes has passed, turn off the heat.
Don't remove the lid and let it steam for 12 minutes.
*Absolutely do not open the lid.
After 12 minutes have passed, the delicious rice is cooked It's difficult to tell from the photo, but there are small spaces in between the rice grains and the grains are standing up.
Do not leave the rice as-is!
Fluff it up gently using a cutting motion.
Ahhh.
It's so delicious You will look forward to eating rice everyday I think the best thing about buying a Staub cocotte is that it makes delicious rice.
Steps 1 and 2 are completely necessary, but sadly they take a lot of time to complete.
I usually prepare it before going to bed or before I go out for the day, and let it sit in the refrigerator.
If the rice hasn't soaked or absorbed enough water, it will taste completely different.
Try to complete both the soaking and absorbing steps within 24 hours.
It's usually said that "too big is better than too small" but try to match the amount of rice to the size of the Staub pot.
The rice will taste different if the pot is too big or too small.
1.5 rice cooker cups of rice is just right for the 2 of us, so I usually make both plain white rice and rice cooked with other ingredients using the 16 cm diameter Staub Round Cocotte.
I usually use the16cm cocotte for 1-1.5 rice cooker cups of rice, the 20cm for 2-2.5 cups of rice, and the 22cm for 3-4 cups of rice.
But you can also use a 10cm Staub to make 0.4 cups of rice.
There are many different sizes you can have fun with.
[If using a 10cm round Staub...] In Step 8, cover with a lid and turn the heat to low.
Set the timer to 9 minutes.
Once the 9 minutes has passed, turn off the heat.
Leave the lid on and let it steam for 10 minutes.
*Absolutely do not remove the lid.
After 10 minutes, gently fluff up the rice taking care not to crush the grains, and it's done If you don't have a small rice paddle, you can use a small general purpose spatula.

Make sure that the room where the dough will be prepared is warm.
In the winter, a temperature of about 22 degrees C and in the summer time, where the temperature in the house could be higher, reduce the quantity of yeast.
As a first step, activate the yeast.
Take 150 ml of warm water and put it into a jug.
Add the granulated yeast and the sugar and give a stir.
Cover the jug with a cloth and wait for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, put the flour into a large bowl and sprinkle with sea salt.
Stir so to evenly distribute the salt within the flour.
After 15 minutes, you should have a frothy layer inside the jug.
Give another stir.
tart gently stirring the flour and at the same time pour the contents of the jug into the bowl.
Add the remaining 150 ml of warm water into the bowl and keep stirring so that all the flour is wet.
Add the extra virgin olive oil.
Give a good stir so that all the ingredients are well mixed together.
Pour the bowl contents onto the working surface and start to work the dough energetically.
Press, extend forward and roll backwards for 10 minutes.
The dough should become smooth and elastic and you should have the feeling that it is sweating.
Coat the dough ball with flour and prepare it for the rising.
For the rising, you can either put the dough ball into a large bowl or leaving the dough ball onto the working surface.
In both cases spread some flour onto the bottom where you will lay the ball dough, so that it will not stick.
Then, cover the ball dough with a cloth and leave it in a warm room for a couple of hours or until it doubles in size.
Spread some flour onto the working surface.
Take the risen dough and work it again for a couple of minutes.
Then, divide the dough in five parts and make a small ball of each part.
Take the rolling pin and start rolling so that you can make a large circle, to suit a 30 cm diameter pizza tray.
The pizza base should be very thin; a couple of millimetres thick.
Spread some flour onto the pizza tray and then lay the pizza base onto the tray.
Top with pizza toppings as you like.
Set the oven at the maximum temperature (usually 240 degrees C - gas mark 9) and pre-heat it properly.
If the oven is at the right temperature and your pizza is thin, it should take about 8-10 minutes to cook.
Fan assisted ovens may require a different cooking time.
After 5 minutes cooking, checking the pizza frequently is a good idea and when the border starts to become golden brown, it is probably the right time to take the pizza out of the oven.



Using on/off turns, blend first 3 ingredients in processor until moist clumps form.
Gather dough into ball; divide in half.
Flatten each dough piece into thin rectangle.
Wrap in plastic; chill until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes.

Add the pancake mix and sugar to a bowl, then add in the butter by crushing it with your hands, and mix so that the dough is crumbly.
Add in the milk and knead.
Knead until the dough comes together and is not floury any more.
Let the dough sit for 5-10 minutes if you have time.
Roll out evenly to a 3 mm thickness with a rolling pin, and cut out your favorite shapes.
(It'll be more crispy and tasty if it's thin.)
Line them up on parchment paper laid on top of aluminum foil.
Lightly place the foil on top and toast in a toaster oven for 10 minutes.
It is OK once it is nicely browned.
Remove the foil and toast for another minute if you want to add more color.
Immediately line up on a cooling rack or paper towel to let cool and to let the water evaporate, and it is done.
You should store them in a storage container.
I think it is okay to reduce the amount of butter down to 30 g.
Extra: if you add in one tea bag into the milk and microwave for a minute and a half, you can make tea cookies.
These will turn out to be very fragrant tea cookies if you use the tea leaves as-is.

Remove and discard the plastic pop-up thermometer.
Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
Refrigerate overnight, uncovered, to let the turkey dry.
(It must be completely dry before frying, or the oil will splatter.)
Fill a turkey fryer with the vegetable oil according to the manufacturer's instructions and heat to 400 degrees F.
Meanwhile, mix the Cajun seasoning and granulated onion in a small bowl.
Rub the spice mixture inside the turkey cavity and all over the skin.
Make sure the hole at the neck is open at least 2 inches so the oil can flow through the bird.
Place the turkey in the drain basket, neck-end first, and slowly lower the basket into the hot oil until the turkey is completely submerged.
Once the oil temperature climbs back up to 350 degrees F, start timing: Fry the turkey until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees F, about 3 1/2 minutes per pound.
(A 12-pound bird will take about 50 minutes from the time you lower it into the oil.)
Carefully remove the basket from the oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.
Let the turkey rest at least 30 minutes.
Make sure that all of the oil has drained out of the cavity, then transfer to a platter.

Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.
Seal tightly, and shake to coat.
Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.
3.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking pan every 4 to 6 minutes for even browning.
Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning.
Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done.
Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary.
Serve immediately.
My Note: I did do 2 changes: 1- we halved them, so that we wouldn't get "mushy middles", lol.
And, I read somewhere that if you remove the "choke" that's at the bottom of the sprout (inside), the brussel sprout will not be bitter.
Voila!
it worked!
These yummmy, salty, nutty, crunchy, carmelized brussel sprouts were SO good.
No bitterness what so ever!
The super dark carmelized parts of the roasted bsprouts were the best!
LUVVVVV this recipe, and will make over and over again!
This time, The only difference is that I sprinkle a few cloves of minced garlic on top as the sprouts roast, which is delicious--the roasted garlic is sweet and compliments the sprouts without overpowering them.
Also, I usually parboil the sprouts first (for 2 minutes).
This draws out bitterness, and cuts down on roasting time (25 minutes to nicely blackened).
Do it just long enough for the outer leaves to turn brown/crispy, about 15 minutes.
So easy, so delicious.
Sometimes I sprinkle balsamic vinegar on top.

In a food processor or blender, process the strawberries and grape juice until smooth.
Slowly add the wine, processing the strawberry mixture until well blended.
Pour into glasses to serve as a beverage, or seal in a large airtight plastic bag and lay flat in the freezer for about 1 hour, or until semisoft, to serve as an ice.
Substitute 2 cups pineapple-orange juice for the grape juice; 16 ounces frozen mixed melon or mixed fruit for the strawberries; and 1 cup diet lemon-lime soda, or 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 tablespoon sugar, for the wine.
Blend as directed.
Serve immediately or freeze until semisoft.
Laying a bag of liquid flat in the freezer helps speed up the freezing process.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, Splenda, brown sugar, baking powder and salt.
Mix well.
In a separate, large mixing bowl, combine soymilk, syrup, egg substitute, butter, applesauce and vanilla extract.
Using an electric mixer or a whisk, mix until thoroughly blended.
(Don't worry if butter bits do not break up completely.)
Add dry ingredients from the first mixing bowl to the mixture in the large one.
Mix until completely blended.
Then fold in the blueberries.
Line a 6-cup muffin pan (or half a 12-cup pan) with baking liners and/or spray with nonstick spray.
Evenly distribute batter among the 6 cups.
Place in the oven and bake for about 22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Enjoy!



Combine all ingredients in a lidded jar, adding salt and pepper to taste.
Shake well and refrigerate.



Plece room temperature noodles in a medium bowl.
In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients.
Mix well, until blended.
(If you are using a thinker type of peanut butter you may need to use more water).
Spoon over noodles and serve.



Combine all ingredients in bowl and stir to combine (I like to use a whip).
Refrigerate until serving.



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Wash and trim green beans.
Lightly pat dry.
Combine soy sauce, oil, and chili sauce in a small bowl.
Place green beans in a 8x8 baking pan.
Add sauce and toss to coat.
Sprinkle almonds on top.
Bake 1015 minutes.
I like mine crispy and firm (10 minutes); my husband likes his softer (15 minutes).
Serve immediately.



Place rice in a pot with sufficient water to cover.
Wash rice three times in the cold water in the pot by rubbing it between your hands.
Drain well after washing.
Add 15 ounces water to the rice and allow it to rest for 1 hour before cooking.
I prefer that so-called old rice be used rice that has been lying about in sacks for extended periods, for it will absorb water better and will cook easier.
(It is often suggested that a ratio of 2 cups of rice to 2 cups of water be used.
This is unsatisfactory because it will be too soft.)
Begin cooking the rice, uncovered, over high heat, by bringing the water to a boil.
Stir the rice with the wooden spoon or chopsticks and cook about 4 minutes or until the water is absorbed, or evaporates.
Even after the water is gone, the rice will continue to be quite hard.
Cover the pot and cook over very low heat for about 8 minutes more, stirring the rice from time to time.
Turn off the heat and loosen the rice with the wooden spoon or chopsticks.
This will help it retain its fluffiness.
Cover tightly until ready to serve.
Just before serving, stir and loosen the rice once again.
Well-cooked rice will have absorbed the water but will not be lumpy, nor will the kernels stick together.
They will be firm and separate.
The rice may be kept hot in a warm oven for an hour without drying out.



Combine peanuts and dried cherries.
Complement snack with a glass of milk.



1.
Place all ingredients (except for yeast) in the bread pan in the order given.
Make sure to be as exact as possible when measuring.
2.
Put yeast in your machines yeast dispenser.
3.
If your machine has the option for a basic or wheat setting, chose BASIC.
Select light crust (if your machine allows you to do so).
Select medium loaf size (if your machine has loaf size options).
4.
Set it and forget it.
5.
Allow bread to cool completely on a wire rack before storing.



Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Drain.
Mash potatoes with a potato masher or an electric mixer on Low in a bowl until smooth.
Heat butter and half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted and half-and-half is warmed, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mash or beat butter mixture, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder into mashed potatoes until potatoes are light and fluffy.
Stir additional half-and-half, 1 tablespoon at a time, into potatoes for creamier consistency.



Drain and rinse your soaked nuts and place in a high speed blender.
Add the maple syrup or honey and vanilla.
Add the water.
Blend at high speed for about 1 minute.
Line a large jug with your nut bag.
Pour the blended mixture into a cheesecloth lined strainer and and gently squeeze out the milk leaving behind only the pulp.You dont have to squeeze it to death, lol(or you can skip this, and leave the pulp.
It will settle to the bottom ).
Refrigerate and enjoy for up to 3 days.
Be zware that the milk does separate, stir or shake before drinking.



Combine water, wine or beer (anything works here; I like red wine best), honey, yeast, and olive oil.
Allow the yeast to soften and bloom for a few minutes.
Add the flour, starting with about 3 cups, and the salt.
Mix, adding flour as neccessary, to form a soft but not sticky dough.
Knead until smooth.
I use setting 4 on my Kitchenaid for about 5 minutes.
Move the dough into an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 45 minutes.
After 45 minutes, place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into the number of pieces you want.
You can make one large pizza, two smaller ones, or 3 or 4 individual-sized pizzas.
Shape each piece into a smooth ball, pulling under and pinching.
Cover balls with a towel and rest for a few minutes while you get your toppings prepared.
Flatten dough with your fingers and top as desired.
Bake in a very hot oven for about 15 minutes or until brown and crispy.
I like a 450-degree oven with a pizza stone.
Enjoy!

Begin by trimming the ribs of any excess fat or sinew.
Remove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs and discard.
Make the rub by combining the brown sugar, salt, chili powder,garlic and onion powder,paprika, cumin, white and cayenne pepper and cloves in a mixing bowl.
Set out large sheets of foil9one set for each slab).
Place one rack on each sheet and divide the dry rub between each slab.
Rub the mixture into the ribs on both sides, and then fold the foil over to form a sealed pouch around each rack.
At this stage make sure each rack is meat-side down.
Place each pouch on a roasting tray and bake in the oven for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, open up the foil and peel back so the ribs are exposed.
Carefully turn the meat over so the meat side is on top.
Brush the top and bottom of the racks with a generous amount of Root Beer BBQ sauce or whatever sauce you wish.
Cook racks for 1 1/2 more hours with the foil open.
When done, the ribs will be tender and the meat will have shrunk back from the bones.
Remove from oven, cut into portions, serve with extra BBQ sauce.

Set aside to cool.
In a separate bowl combine oats and your 1 cup of brown sugar.
In another bowl cut in butter with flour, baking soda and salt (previously sifted together).
It is best to work with cold pieces of butter as they are easier to cut into the flour.
Once butter and flour are mixed together thoroughly, combine with oats and brown sugar.
Press half of the oat mixture over the bottom of a greased 8 x 8 square pan.
Pack the layer down firmly with a fork.
Next place entire date mixture on top of the base, for the second layer.
Cover and spread evenly.

I think you could get away with using less powdered sugar in the filling if you dont like your desserts tooth-achingly sweet (like we Southerners do).
If you want to get super decadent, top this cake with chocolate whipped cream: whip 7 tablespoons heavy cream with 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.
Frost just before serving.



Use a flat pan over medium heat to dry-roast the peanuts and/or walnuts (if using).
Stir constantly (so they dont burn) until the peanuts are fragrant, about 10 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and allow the nuts to cool completely.
Once the peanuts are completely cool, use your hands to loosen the skins from the peanuts.
Now, the next part is a little tricky.
Grasp the pan with both hands, and toss the peanuts up and down, while angling the pan slightly downward.
If all goes right, the peanuts should flip up in the air and land back into the pan while the skins fly out over the sides.
Its a good idea to do this over the sink.
Of course, you can also buy shelled, already skinned peanuts.
You can also buy plain roasted peanuts of course, but roasting them at home will make the peanut brittle taste a lot fresher.
Next, crush the peanuts into smaller pieces by laying them on a large cutting board or clean kitchen surface and rolling with a rolling pin.
Set the peanuts aside.
Now brush the surface of your cutting board and rolling pin with a very light layer of oil to prevent sticking when you pour the brittle on it later.
Using the same pan from earlier, melt the rock sugar by stirring constantly over medium low heat.
It will take about 5 minutes to melt the rock sugar completely.
Add the peanuts and sesame seeds to the melted sugar and mix well.
Quickly pour the hot peanut and sugar mixture onto the greased, flat surface of your cutting board and immediately roll it out to about 1/3-inch thick.
Cut into desired size and shape.
Enjoy!

Quickly pour the fudge into a foil-lined bread loaf pan and place it into the refrigerator overnight or until it is firm and fully chilled.
Note : You can also pour the fudge into a foil-lined 8-inch square pan.
To slice, take the fudge out of the refrigerator and tip the pan upside-down to remove the foil.
Then, let the fudge slab stand for 15-30 minutes or until it softens slightly but is still cold.
(You don't need to let the fudge soften if you use the 8-inch square pan, just slice it into 1 1/2 inch squares.)

Add powdered sugar and mix till smooth.
Slowly add honey and egg whites.
At flour 1/3 at a time and mix till smooth.
Can use right away but works better when chilled.
Cut out desired size circle in a piece of cardboard.
I use a circle the size of a cereal bowl but bigger will work just as well.
Preheat oven to 300F.
Lay a non-stick pad on a cookie sheet.
Then lay your cut out down on the sheet and spread a very thin but even layer of batter on it.
Fill your sheet up then place in oven for a couple of minutes.
You are going to have to watch it closely.
When they start to bubble but are still pale it means they are getting close to being done.
Pull them out when they are golden brown and immediately place them inside a bowl to shape.
Sometimes a bowl of cold water is nice to stick your fingers in if they get burnt.
You can make smaller circles and roll them up like a cannoli.
They are great dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with toasted almonds and or toasted coconut.
You can also fill them with whipped cream!
**If you want add other flavors like almond extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, vanilla extract or what ever you heart desires, it adds a nice twist to the honey flavor!



Preheat the oven to 400.
Spread the potatoes on a large rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with the oil, and toss to coat.

Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Cut into 15 pieces per pan (1 inch wide).
Bake 1/2 hour at 300-325F Let cool.



To make the mixing as painless as possible, I often take 1 cup of sugar and blend it with the baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder.
This breaks up all the little clumps before you tackle the monster-big bowl of dry ingredients.
I've found a whisk to be most helpful for this task.
Once you've got a clump-free mixture, mix in the rest of the flour and sugar, being very careful that no pockets of un-mixedness remain.
I put mine in quart-sized ziploc bags, 2 1/4 cups per bag.
(sandwich bags can be used, but they don't come in the heavy-weight freezer-caliber plastic -- the last thing I want all over my pantry is a batch of brownie mix.
Also, the freezer weight has a label on it already) Label each bag with the recipe which is as follows:.
1 bag of brownie mix, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine.
Blend well (mixture will be very thick).
Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts if desired (I've never tried the walnuts due to allergies).
Pour mixture into a cooking-sprayed 8x8" inch pan.
Bake at 350F for 30-35 minutes.
For a very fudgey brownie, turn the heat down to 325F and cook for 35 minutes, until a toothpick tests clean.
Be sure to refrigerate extra-fudgy brownies.
To serve, I cut 1/4" off of each side (while still in the pan) and remove the "brownie sticks" before cutting and removing individual pieces.
My family loves the brownie sticks, and the serving pieces are much more clean.
Store them covered.
These brownies never need frosting (in my opinion) and make a great source for emergency chocolate.

Combine yogurt, cinnamon and lemon curd; blend well.
Serve over any combination of cold or warm fruit you like.



Mince apricots in blender.
Combine with 1 1/2 cups of coconut and all other ingredients (reserving 1/2 cup coconut for rolling) and blend well.

This is a very healthy and hearty way to start the morning.
I like this cereal much better than most other mixed grain cereals I have tried.
The rice gives the cooked cereal a nice chewy texture which contrasts nicely with the smoothness of the whole wheat flour and cornmeal.
If you don't have quick barley, you can replace it with more oatmeal, or even wheat germ, or wheat bran.
I've also thought that Rye Flour might make a nice addition, although I have never tried it.
This cereal is an excellent source of B vitamins and fiber.

I love liver.
One of my favorite ways to prepare it is broiling.
I place the liver on the broiler pan, cover it with bottled french dressing and broil about three min.
Turn it over, cover with more dressing, and broil another three min.
I found the most common problem with cooking liver is over cooking it, why in the world does it have to be cooked like shoe leather

This is a super easy recipe that is a wondeful way to make breakfast special.
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
You will need tinfoil, parchment paper, non-stick cooking spray, a cookie sheet and a metal rack like a cookie cooling rack that is oven safe.
Cover your cookie sheet with tinfoil making sure the tinfoil folds over the edges of your cookie sheet.
Trust me this will make clean up so much easier.
Line the inside of the cookie sheet with parchment paper to soak up the bacon grease.
If you dont have parchment paper you can put down a layer of salt in the cookie sheet to soak up the bacon grease.
This keeps it from spalttering inside your oven.
Spray the rack with non-stick spray and lay it on the cookie sheet.
It should fit inside the edges of the sheet pan.
I use 24 ounces of thick cut bacon because when I make this I want a bunch of it but you can use any amount you want.
Put a cup of brown sugar in a shallow bowl, pan or plate.
I use a pie plate but a sheet pan would work really well.
I like to use something with a lip on it so that the sugar mixture doesnt get everywhere.
Add the chili powder to the sugar and mix well with a fork, whisk or your hands.
Dredge the bacon in the sugar mixture making sure every bit of the bacon is covered in a nice thick layer.
Lay the bacon slices close together on the rack.
If you have a tiny 21 inch oven like me youll have to cook the 24 ounces in a couple of batches.
Oh how I envy those of you with bigger ovens.
Bake it for about 40 minutes checking every once in while as baking times are approximate.
See the aforementioned lament regarding tiny ovens.
You want the bacon done and not burned.
When its done remove from the oven and try to keep from eating it all at once.
Its hard.
Enjoy!

Marinate the shrimp in the vinaigrette for 20 minutes or so.
Drain the shrimp, retaining the marinade.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook shrimp until pink, about 3 minutes.
Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.
Place marinade, cream cheese and half of the basil in the skillet.
Cook and stir until well blended; return shrimp to pan and continue cooking until heated thoroughly, stirring occasionally.
To serve, place a mount of noodles on plate; top with shrimp and sauce mixture.
Sprinkle with remaining basil and the shredded parmesan cheese.
You can also add fresh chopped tomatoes for extra flavor, color and texture.
I only bought the shrimp and basil to make this meal; all other ingredients came from my pantry and fridge.
Half a pound of shrimp cost $3.00, and the portion of basil I used about $0.50.
The pasta was free, using coupons at a Harris Teeter doubling event, and I paid less that $1.00 for the entire package of cream cheese, making the portion I used about $0.25.
Making my own vinaigrette cost pennies, as did shredding the Parmesan from a block.
I would estimate the cost of this main dish to be around $4.00 0r less.
The additional side dishes and bread would bring the total to somewhere between $5.00 or $6.00.
Not bad for an elegant anniversary dinner!

Flatten each scoop of dough using your hand, so that each cookie is thin.
Bake the cookies for about 18-25 minutes.
Start checking the cookies at about the 15 minute mark (or a few minutes before that) to see if they have browned.
If the cookies are quite brown around the edges, remove them from the oven.
I wanted my cookies to be more crisp and brown, so I left them in there for about 22 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool.
Enjoy the cookies when cooled!

1.
If the potatoes are refrigerated, take them out of the refrigerator at least half an hour before you cook them.
Wash them under cool, running water, scrubbing off any dirt without breaking the skin, and put them in a large kettle which will easily hold all the potatoes.
Add in sufficient water to cover them by about an inch.
Take the potatoes out, cover the kettle, and put it over medium-high heat.
2.
When the water is nearly but not quite boiling, add in the potatoes.
Now let the water come to a full, rolling boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook at a bare simmer till they are tender.
It is impossible to give exact times; it can take from 10 to 30 min, depending on the size and age of your potatoes.
3.
Drain off all the water and let the potatoes sit, uncovered, in a hot place for about 5 min.
Have a heated bowl ready.
Quickly peel the potatoes with your hands (do not use a knife or possibly potato peeler), the skins will skip right off.
Put them in the bowl as they are peeled.
4.
Serve them tossed with melted butter, salt, and a liberal grinding of black pepper, if you like, or possibly use as directed in other recipes.
NOTES : A side bar says: Start with good potatoes; The potatoes should be be same size (roughly).
Do not cut them to uniform size either, since this would expose the inner potato to water.
Resist the temptation to rinse the potatoes in cool water to speed the peeling.

spot in your kitchen, such as nearby an oven.
Or if you live in a hot place like Florida, put them in your car for a bit.
Once they grow a little, throw them into the oven at about 425.
Check on them after 10 minutes and pull them out when they turn a nice golden brown.
Brush more of the sauce on, lightly, and sprinkle with the grated cheese.
Best enjoyed warm.

Initial Cleaning (before first use): remove the factory coating - to do this, fill the pan 1/2 to 2/3 full with water.
Boil 5-7 minute Pour the water out of the pan.
Immediately scrub with hot soapy water and harsh scouring pad.
Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care.
Scrub vigorously both inside and out, then rinse and wipe dry.
Immediately season your pan.
Initial Seasoning: rub 2 tbsp cooking oil over the entire surface of the pan.
Place over medium heat for about 10 minute Using a paper towel, distribute the oil over the inside of the pan while it is heating.
Tilt the pan over the burner so that the sides of the pan heat as well as the bottom.
Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care.
Remove the pan from the heat and cool.
Repeat 3-4 times.
Your pan is now seasoned and ready to use.
Basic Care: wash with hot water only (no soap) and immediately dry thoroughly.
Soaps or detergents will remove the seasoning.
Remove burned food with a scouring pad and hot water.
Apply a light film of cooking oil before storing to prevent rusting.
If you use soap to clean your pan, simply follow the initial seasoning instructions to restore to protective finish.
If your pan becomes rusted, simply scour and re-season.
A well-seasoned pan will naturally darken with use.
Do not leave food in pan after cooking.
Do not wash in dishwasher.

Put the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, wheat germ, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl and gently whisk until all the ingredients are incorporated and there are no visible lumps.
Beat the butter in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment at high speed until it is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add the brown sugar, crumbling it with your hands as you add it to remove any lumps, and mix on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
Add the honey and mix until combined.
Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl using a rubber spatula halfway through mixing to ensure that the ingredients are combined.
Add approximately half the flour mixture and mix on low speed just until the flour is incorporated, about 30 seconds.
Repeat with the remaining flour.
Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure the flour is fully incorporated.
Empty the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently push it together.
Form it into a flat disk 1 to 2 inches thick.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 days.
Once the dough has chilled, it can be rolled and used as directed (see Rolling Dough, page 10), or frozen in sheets (wrapped tightly with plastic wrap on a sheet pan or piece of cardboard) until needed or for up to 2 months.
If baking immediately, preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper or spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.
Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper or on a lightly floured flat surface.
Lightly flour the top of the disk and begin rolling the dough.
Lift and rotate the dough between each roll to prevent it from sticking.
Repeat the process until the dough is between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick.
Using a paring knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them about 1/2 inch apart on the prepared pans.
To coat, combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and toss lightly with a fork.
Sprinkle the dough with the sugar mixture.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the pans once halfway through, until the cookies are a dark golden brown color.
Remove the cookies from the oven, let them cool slightly on the pans, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
Serve the cooled cookies immediately, or keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
These graham crackers also taste great when coated in dark chocolate.
Simply bake them without sugar and cinnamon on top, then follow the directions to dip the cookies from Chocolate Mint Cookies (page 63) or Dipping in Chocolate (page 17).



In a large mixing bowl, stir together water, yeast, and sugar.
Let stand for 5 minutes.
With a wooden spoon, stir in oil, malt and one cup of the flour.

Bring water to a boil.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line two large baking sheets with baking parchment and, if desired, sprinkle generously with corn meal.
Set aside.
Line two other baking sheets with a kitchen towel, set near your stove.
Reduce boiling water to a simmer and cook 2 bagels at a time (do not crowd the pot).
Simmer bagels for about 45 seconds on one side, then turn and cook other side for another 45 seconds and then drain bagels on the towel-lined baking sheet.
Carefully place bagels on the parchment-lined baking sheets.
Bake bagels plain or sprinkle with a topping of your choice.
Place in the hot oven, immediately reduce heat to 425 degrees F, and bake about 17 to 25 minutes.
When almost baked, turn bagels over (a pair of tongs do the job easily).
If you have a baking stone, finish bagels on the stone directly.
Transfer bagels to wire rack to cool.
These freeze well, which helps to retain a just-baked taste, if they aren't all eaten on the first day.
To freeze, slice cooled bagels first, place a small strip of plastic between the bagel halves and place in a plastic self-sealing freezer bag.
When you're ready for a bagel, they'll come apart easily, ready to pop into the toaster/oven and enjoy.

To make loaves, divide into 2 portions.
flatten into rectangle about 4" x 12", folding the 12" sides toward the center and pinch together, also pinch the ends.
sprinkle cornmeal on pans and place pinched seam down.
Sprinkle more cornmeal on top and sides of loaves and cover gently with plastic wrap then place a light towel on top (to keep them cozy warm).
To make buns, divide dough into 8 portions and pinch into round shapes, putting the pinched side down, in the same manner with the loaves.
(The tension created by pinching, or sealing any open seams allows the bread to rise instead of just spreading sideways like a blob.
).
Let rise again for another 45 minutes.
During this time, I check to make sure the bread is not sticking to the plastic, adding more cornmeal, if it is.
Even if the bread sticks and falls as you pull the plastic away, it does no great damage, the bread just looks ugly, (tastes fine).
Put the bottom of your broiler pan in the bottom of the oven and heat the oven to 425.
(make sure that the pan is very close to the oven door.
).
When temp is reached, put bread into oven (back a little from the door), pour 2 cups cold water into broiler pan, and turn temp down to 400.
Bake 20-30 minutes.
I usually check after 20 minutes and give more time as needed.
I brush off all the excess cornmeal and slice the buns before they get too cool.

Slice into 1-inch slices and drizzle with remaining glaze to serve.



Mix all ingredients in a mixing bowl until creamy.



In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water.
Sprinkle yeast over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy.
Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, then mix in the whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour until dough starts to come together.
Tip dough out onto a surface floured with the remaining all-purpose flour, and knead until all of the flour has been absorbed, and the ball of dough becomes smooth, about 10 minutes.
Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface.
Cover loosely with a towel, and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
When the dough is doubled, tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 2 pieces for 2 thin crust, or leave whole to make one thick crust.
Form into a tight ball.
Let rise for about 45 minutes, until doubled.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Roll a ball of dough with a rolling pin until it will not stretch any further.
Then, drape it over both of your fists, and gently pull the edges outward, while rotating the crust.
When the circle has reached the desired size, place on a well oiled pizza pan.
Top pizza with your favorite toppings, such as sauce, cheese, meats, or vegetables.
Bake for 16 to 20 minutes (depending on thickness) in the preheated oven, until the crust is crisp and golden at the edges, and cheese is melted on the top.



Keep the ratio of catsup and honey about even, but the heat of sauce can be adjusted by adding more or less horseradish.



Fill a large bowl with ice water and set a smaller bowl inside.
Set a fine-mesh strainer in the smaller bowl.
Whisk the cornstarch and 1 cup of the milk together in a medium bowl until the cornstarch dissolves.
Combine the sugar, milk powder, corn syrup, salt, and the remaining 3 cups of milk in a medium (4-quart) saucepan over high heat.
Whisk to break up and dissolve the milk powder and heat the milk until it just begins to bubble.
Turn off the heat and gradually add the milk-cornstarch mixture, whisking constantly.
Return the heat to high and bring the milk back to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium high and cook, stirring constantly with the whisk, until the gelato base thickens slightly, 4 to 5 minutes.
It will get viscous but will not thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Pour the gelato base through the strainer into the bowl set over the ice water and set aside to cool to room temperature.
Transfer the base to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least several hours and up to three days.
Place a medium stainless steel bowl in the freezer.
Remove the base from the refrigerator, pour it into a separate bowl, and stir in the cream.
Pour the base into the bowl of an ice cream maker and spin it according to the machine instructions.
Set a stainless steel bowl over a pot of water or fill the bottom of a double boiler with water, making sure the water doesnt touch the top vessel, and bring the water to a simmer over medium heat.
Add the chocolate to the bowl or double boiler and let it melt, without stirring.
Turn off the heat.
Take the stainless steel bowl out of the refrigerator.
Spoon the gelato out of the ice cream maker into the bowl.
Use a spoon to drizzle one-quarter of the melted chocolate over the gelato in thin strands.
Use a large metal spoon or metal spatula to break up the chocolate strands and fold them into the gelato.
Drizzle another quarter of the chocolate over the gelato and cut it into the gelato in the same way.
Continue until youve used all of the chocolate.
Cover the bowl and return the gelato to the freezer to firm slightly before serving.
Serve it within a few hours of spinning it, before it hardens.

Mix lemon juice, chives and pepper into butter.
Serve with corn grilled in its husks.



Coat the bottom of a metal spatula and a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with butter; set aside.
Combine 8 cups of the marshmallows and the butter in a medium pot and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until melted and smooth, about 8 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in cereal until well coated.
Add remaining 3 cups marshmallows and stir just until mixed.
Immediately turn mixture into the prepared baking dish and use the buttered spatula to uniformly flatten.
Let set up until room temperature and firm, about 45 minutes.
Cut into 15 (2-1/2-inch-by-2-1/2-inch) squares and serve.



1.
In a mixing bowl, combine applesauce and sugar.
Add pumpkin, shortening and vanilla.
Combine dry ingredients; gradually add the dry mixture into pumpkin mixture and mix well.
Stir in zucchini and nuts.
2.
Pour into two greased and floured 9-inch x 5-inch x 3-inch loaf pans.
3.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until breads test done.
Cool in pans 10 minutes.
Remove to a wire rack.



Lightly grease a baking sheet.
In a 1 quart glass measure, combine walnut halves, sugar, and water.

Heat oven to 300F.
Spread almonds and pecans on cookie sheet and toast lightly (about 15 min).
Once nuts have cooled, mix with popped popcorn in VERY large buttered bowl.
Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup and cream of tartar in a heavy saucepan (this mixture will expand 2-3 times larger one you add the final ingredient so make sure your pan is big enough).
Cook mixture slowly on medium heat until it forms a hard ball when dropped in cold water (252F on candy thermometer).
Remove from heat, quickly stir in salt, rum flavoring and baking soda.
WARNING: This is like napalm and it sticks to skin until thoroughly burned; it will quickly start expanding when soda is added.
Pour the napalm candy over popcorn and nuts, mixing with two buttered forks until popcorn and nuts are fully coated.
Do this as quickly as possible because everything will harden once removed from heat.
Spread the gooey popcorn mixture evenly over buttered cookie sheet and let it cool.
Enjoy!
Tips: use wood or metal utensils only!
Silicone or plastic will melt in the napalm candy (as will most thermometers that are not designed for candy).
I find that the popcorn sticks to the candy easier than the nuts, so I typically mix the nuts into the candy just before pouring over the popcorn.
If you like it more brittle and less chewy, try baking the completed poppycock mixture @275F for 15-20 minutes.



Heat oven to 400F.
Cover baking sheet with foil; spray foil with cooking spray.
Place beets on prepared baking sheet.
Bake 1 hour or until tender.
Remove from oven; cool slightly.
Meanwhile, combine nuts and honey in small skillet; cook on medium-high heat 4 to 6 min.

Enough for 2 pounds meat.



Place cream cheese on shallow serving dish.
Pour raspberry chipotle sauce over top of cream cheese and allow it to drizzle down sides.



Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with plastic wrap, overlapping as needed to completely cover the bottom and sides and leaving at least a 5-inch overhang.
(If possible, use a pan that does not have sloping sides.)
Place the ice cream in a large bowl and add the nuts and marshmallows.
Working quickly, fold the nuts and marshmallows into the ice cream with a rubber spatula until evenly combined.
Drop the ice cream in large dollops into the prepared pan and spread to the edges with a rubber spatula.
Cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and press on the surface of the ice cream with the bottom of a measuring cup until its packed into a smooth, even layer.
Freeze until solid, at least 3 hours.
Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper.
Tape each corner of the paper down and place the baking sheets in the freezer.
When the ice cream is solid, remove the pan and 1 baking sheet from the freezer.
Grasping the plastic wrap, pull the ice cream slab out of the pan and place it on a cutting board.
Remove and discard the plastic wrap.
Slice the slab into 9 even squares.
Using a flat spatula, transfer and evenly space the squares on the baking sheet.
Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours.
Fill a large bowl with 2 inches of cold water, add 3 to 4 ice cubes, and set aside.
Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, reduce the heat to low and maintain a bare simmer.
Place 24 ounces of the chocolate in a large, dry, heatproof bowl.
Set the bowl over the saucepan and stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F. If either happens, start over, as the chocolate is no longer usable.)
Remove the bowl from the saucepan.
Add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate and stir constantly, scraping against the bottom of the bowl, until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. To speed the cooling process, after all of the chocolate has melted you can place the bowl over the reserved cold-water bath.
Return the bowl to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat.
Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range or it will not set up properly.)
Keep the saucepan over low heat and use it to reheat the chocolate as necessary.
To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on parchment or waxed paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set.
If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered.
(If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.)
Have a fork and flat spatula ready.
Remove the empty baking sheet and the baking sheet with the ice cream squares from the freezer.
Working quickly, use the flat spatula to drop 1 ice cream square into the chocolate.
Using the fork, flip the square, making sure the edges are covered in chocolate.
Lift the square out of the chocolate with the fork and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl to even out the coating.
Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate.
Place the coated square on the empty baking sheet.
Repeat with the remaining squares and chocolate, tilting the bowl as needed to pool the chocolate in one area, and spacing the squares as close together as possible on the baking sheet without touching.
(If the ice cream squares start to melt, return them to the freezer until firm before continuing.)
Freeze the dipped ice cream bars until the chocolate coating has hardened and the ice cream is solid, at least 2 hours.
Wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then foil, and store in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.



Makes a 1 lb loaf
Add in ingredients according to the directions on your Bread maker.



Rub the butter into the flour.
Add the salt and soda, mix all well together by running the dry ingredients through your fingers.
Add the buttermilk (or sweet milk) and stir into a soft dough with a wooden spoon.
With your floured hands, knead the dough lightly into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured baking sheet.
Flatten the dough into a circle 1 1/2 inches thick with the palm of your hand.
Make a cross in the center with a floured knife.
Bake at 425 degrees F. for 30 to 35 minutes.



Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, combine the oil and water (and milk, if using 2 Tbsp water and 2 Tbsp milk).
Pour liquid mixture all at once into the sifted mixture, and then - with your hands - press the dough into a smooth ball.
Be careful not to overwork the dough or it can become tough; it will be somewhat crumbly and soft.
To use, press the dough into the pie shell and shape the edges into flutes with your fingers.
If there are thin spots, the dough is soft enough to easily to press extra into them with no worries.
Note: use any left over pieces of dough by baking them into little snack crackers.
This dough freezes and thaws really well!



Mill sugar 3 seconds/speed 9.
Add cooking oil, non-dairy milk, and vanilla extract.
Mix 5 seconds/speed 4.
Add in the salt and flour.
Mix 10 seconds/speed 6.
Set speed to 6 and pour the baking powder in through the hole in the lid.
Following the directions on your waffle iron - go ahead and cook up your waffles!
This recipe makes puffier waffles than the old eggy/buttery one I used to use.
Perhaps spread the batter a little thinner in your iron than you usually do.



Combine all ingredients except olive oil in a food processor or blender.
Puree until smooth.
Next, add oil slowly to the mixture in the food processor or blender until completely combined.



Simmer all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low heat until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.



Mix, cut in butter till coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle over pie and bake till golden.



Melt butter in a skillet over moderate heat.

Serve warm or at room temperature.



Mix together the coconut oil, peanut butter, cocoa powder until the cocoa powder is fully incorporated.
Add the splenda and vanilla.
Next incorporate the coconut and pecans.
Use a spoon to drop cookies onto a wax paper-lined baking sheet.
Chill until set.
I make small cookies with these.
If you like them small like I do, you will get approximately 18 cookies.
If you like them larger, by all means make them larger, it will just increase the setting time.



Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until creamy.
(**I think this is where personal preference and maybe even altitude will effect the outcome of these crackers.
I started out with 1 stick of butter, then blended all the other ingredients together.
The "dough" was too crumbly and looked like a struesel topping that you would put on top of muffins or a coffee cake.
The one stick of butter is what Ina calls for in her recipe.
I think this is a typo.
I added another 1/2 stick of butter to the flour mixture, and then beat it with the paddle attachment on my mixer.
This is when the "dough" balled up and looked right.
So, I think this recipe needs between 1 stick and 1 1/2 sticks.
You might even get by with 1 1/4 sticks.
).
Add the Parmesan, flour, salt, thyme and pepper and combine.
Dump the dough on a lightly floured board and roll into a 13-inch long log.
Wrap the log in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to harden.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Cut the log crosswise into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices.
Place the slices on a sheet pan and bake for 22-25 minutes.
**Cook time does not include freezing the dough for between 15-30 minutes (mine were hard enough to easily cut at 15 minutes).



Preheat oven to 350.

Chill until ready to serve.



In a steamer, set over boiling water, steam the carrots, covered, for 4 to 8 minutes, or until they are just tender.
In a small skillet melt the butter with the honey over moderately low heat, add the carrots and salt and pepper to taste, and cook the carrots, tossing them, for 1 minute, or until they are well-coated with the glaze.



Mix together cream and buttermilk in glass container.
Cover and let stand at room temp for 12 hours without disturbing.
Stir and chill for 6 hours.
Stir again and serve as is, or add the sugar to serve on pies and such.



Put the Brussels sprouts and onions in the top of a two-part steamer or on a steaming rack or a plate in a bamboo steamer.
Fill the bottom of the steamer pan or a pan large enough to hold the bamboo or steaming rack with water; the water should not touch the rack.
Bring to a boil over medium heat.
Place the vegetables on top, cover and steam for 10 to 11 minutes, or until a knife easily slips into the flesh.
Set aside.

Spoon the filling over the chilled crust, and smooth out the top surface.
Refrigerate for 6 hours, or overnight.
Just before serving, whip cream with 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar until stiff in a small bowl using an electric mixer.
Run a knife around the outside edge of the cake, and remove the sides of the pan.
Spread the whipped cream over the top of the cake, and sprinkle with remaining grated chocolate.
Serve immediately.



In a sauce pan, combine the cranberries and apple juice.
Cook over medium-low heat until berries burst.
Additional sugar may be added if desired.
Mix well, chill and serve.



Spoon yogurt into a bowl.
Add protein powder (I often add about 1 T. granulated lecithin as well).

Add the vanilla and stir until smooth.
Set aside to cool to room temperature, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Then beat the chocolate at medium speed, using an electric mixer, until it is thick and light colored.
If the chocolate has cooled enough, it will be ready to form truffles right away.
If the chocolate is still too soft to hold its shape when rolled in a ball, spread over the bottom of a baking dish and smooth the top.
Refrigerate until firmed, but still scoopable, up to 2 hours.
Pour the cocoa powder onto a deep plate or shallow bowl.
Use a melon baller or small ice cream scoop to scoop out balls of chocolate and gently roll into a ball.
Place them on the plate with the cocoa powder and roll between 2 forks to completely coat with the cocoa powder.
Then use the forks to carefully transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment or waxed paper.
If making the truffles a day or two ahead of time, let them stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving.
Cook's Note: A pair of disposable latex gloves will help your hands stay clean while rolling the truffles.

Shut off heat and move pan.
Sauce will thicken as it sits.
Serve fresh or freeze up to 3 months.



First, peel that ginger.
(I find the quickest and least wasteful way to peel ginger is with the side of a teaspoon.
Holding the teaspoon at a slight angle and with the back of the spoon facing you scrape down the ginger.
The skin comes off so much easier.)
Now chop it into small dice.
Cover your ginger with the 3 cups of water and simmer over medium heat, with the lid on, for 20 minutes in a LARGE saucepan*.
It will still feel quite firm at this stage.
Strain into a jug, catch all of the ginger pieces in your strainer and reserve all the liquid.
Put 2 1/2 cups of the reserved liquid and 2 1/2 cups sugar in the saucepan and add back in the ginger pieces.
Bring this mix up to a rolling boil and keep it there until your sugar thermometer reaches 106C or 225F.
(This stage is likely to take longer than you think.
I find that it quickly nearly reaches the temperature but takes a good ten minutes to actually hit 225F/106C.
Watch it though.
Once it reaches the correct temperature take it off the heat.
Strain the ginger straight away while it is still hot (reserving the syrupy liquid for your lattes and ice-cream) and toss the ginger pieces into more sugar until they are coated.
Let cool then keep in the fridge.
(My crystallized ginger is pink because I had less sugar in the house than I thought and ended up using my experimental batch of rose scented sugar).
(I also want to add just two things.
1) Please be careful when working with any hot liquid but especially hot sugar and 2) * Use a much bigger pan than you think you will use.
When the sugary water comes to a rolling boil it will at least triple in size.
A bigger pan will educe the risk of spills and burns.)

Add flour, salt and malt powder and mix at low speed for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment.
Cover the dough and allow to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.
Punch the dough down and shape into a rough rectangle about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick, and about 2 times longer than it is wide.
If you are having trouble forming the dough, stretch it, wait for the gluten to relax and reform.
Cut the dough into 10 pieces of about 3 ounces each.
Roll each into an 8-inch-long snakelike shape, tapering the dough at each end.
Circle the dough around your hand, pinching the ends together and rolling under your palm once or twice to seal.
Put the bagels on a Silpat or other nonstick baking sheet on top of a jellyroll pan.
Cover well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 10 hours, or up to 24 hours.
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
If you have a baking stone or brick you use for baking, put it on a rack near the bottom of the oven; it will retain heat and produce a crisper bagel.
Bring a large pot of water to boil, throw a handful of salt into the boiling water and remove the bagels from the refrigerator.
Using your hands, carefully place just enough bagels into the pot to cover the surface of the water, making sure that there are no bagels resting on top of one another.
Let them float on one side for about 30 seconds before flipping them to the other side for another 30 seconds or so.
Remove the bagels and drain well on a cooling rack.
Pour poppy or sesame seeds into a bowl wider than the bagels.
Working very quickly, remove the bagels one by one and dip them into the topping.
Place them back on the Silpat-covered baking sheet, topping side down.
Bake on the second to highest shelf of the oven for about 7 minutes.
Then flip the bagels and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown.



In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter.
Add sugar and salt.
Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar is completely dissolved, then adjust heat to medium and boil 2 minutes longer.
Add maple syrup and boil, stirring frequently, until sauce is thick, smooth, and coats a spoon, 2 to 4 minutes longer.
Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Pour into heatproof decorative jars and cool completely.
Refrigerate in tightly sealed jars for up to 2 months.
Tie a ribbon around each jar and attach a gift tag with suggested serving ideas (for instance, "Drizzle on banana pancakes, waffles, french toast, or vanilla ice cream") and mention that sauce should be reheated before serving.



Combine all ingredients.
Use immediately or cover tightly and refrigerate for up to a week.
Use for duck, beef, or pork.



Whip butter until creamy.
Add whipping cream and whip until fluffy and light colored.
Add brown sugar and cinnamon.
Beat on low speed until incorporated.
Fold in raisins, pineapple, and pecans.
For sweet potatoes: Use a melon baller or small portioning scoop to form small balls.
Place on wax paper lined baking sheet and freeze.
After freezing the balls can be stored in a zip top bag.
Place ball in sweet potato at time of serving.
For breads: Spoon butter into a sealable container.
Store in fridge.



In the bowl of an electric mixer or food processor or by hand, mix the flour, 2 tsps.
salt, the yeast, barley malt syrup and 1 cup plus 2 Tbsps.
water until the ingredients form a stiff, coarse ball of dough (about 3 minutes if mixing by hand or in a mixer; or 1 minute in a food processor).
If necessary, add a little more water.
Let the dough rest 5 minutes.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until the dough feels stiff yet supple, with a satiny, slightly tacky feel, 2 to 3 minutes.
If the dough seems too soft or too tacky, sprinkle over just enough flour as needed.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to several hours.
Keep in mind that the bagels must be shaped before proofing overnight.
When ready to shape the bagels, line a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide it into 6 to 8 equal pieces.
Form each piece into a loose, round ball by rolling it on a clean, dry work surface with a cupped hand; do not use any flour on the surface.
If the dough slides around and won't ball up, wipe the work surface with a damp paper towel and try again -- the slight amount of moisture will provide enough "bite" for the dough to form a ball.
When each piece has been formed into a ball, you are ready to shape the bagels.
Using your hands and a fair amount of pressure, roll each dough ball into a "rope" 8 to 10 inches long.
(Moisten the work surface with a damp paper towel, if necessary, to get the necessary bite or friction).
Slightly taper the rope at the ends so that they are thinner than the middle.
Place one end of the dough between your thumb and forefinger and wrap it around your hand until the ends overlap in your palm; they should overlap by about 2 inches.
Squeeze the overlapping ends together and then press the joined ends into the work surface, rolling them back and forth a few times until they are completely sealed.
Remove the dough from your hand and squeeze as necessary to even out the thickness so that there is a 2-inch hole in the center.
Place the bagel on the prepared sheet pan.
Repeat with the other pieces.
Lightly wipe the bagels with oil, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight.
Remove the bagels from the refrigerator 90 minutes before you plan to bake them.
Fill a large stockpot with 3 quarts of water (be sure the water is at least 4 inches deep), cover with a lid, and slowly bring the water to a boil.
When it comes to a boil, add the remaining teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoons of baking soda, reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on.
Thirty minutes before baking, heat the oven to 500 degrees.
Test the bagels by placing one in a bowl of cold water.
If it sinks and doesn't float to the surface, return it to the sheet, wait 15 minutes and then test it again.
When one bagel passes the float test, they are ready for the pot.
Gently lift each bagel and drop it into the simmering water.
Add as many as will comfortably fit in the pot.
After 1 minute, use a slotted spoon to flip each bagel over.
Poach for an extra 30 seconds.
Using the slotted spoon, remove each bagel and return it to the lined baking sheet.
Continue until all the bagels have been poached.
Generously sprinkle each bagel with a topping, except for cinnamon sugar (see note below).
Place the baking sheet in the oven and reduce the heat to 450 degrees.
Bake for 8 minutes and then rotate the sheet (if using two sheets, also switch their positions).
Check the underside of the bagels.
If they are getting too dark, place another sheet under the baking sheet (i.e., double-pan it).
Bake until the bagels are golden brown, an additional 8 to 12 minutes.
Remove from the oven and transfer the bagels to a rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.
Note: If using cinnamon sugar (1 part cinnamon to 5 parts granulated sugar), immediately brush the top of each hot bagel with melted butter and then generously sprinkle with the mixture so that it is coated.
It will form a nice cinnamon crust as it cools.

Puree the liver I use a food processor.
I prefer lamb liver for dogs with allergies but I have used chicken, pork or beef liver.
if you use beef or pork liver cut it up into small chunks before processing or the processor might jam up.
Once the liver is processed I add the cooked (cooled) green beans to the mix including the water.
Process it till it is lump free.
You may have to process it in small amounts till it's all done.
Put all pureed ingredients in a bowl add the instant mashed potatoes gradually while stirring.
you should end up with a thick paste if its to runny to hold up on it's own add more potatoes.
Press it flat on greased cookie sheets about a 1/3 of an inch thick (more than a quarter inch less than a 1/2).
The thicker the cookie the longer they take to bake.
I use a piece of plastic baffle from lighting to score the dough but you could use a pizza cutter this is not a biscuit recipe but soft reward treats so they can be made small or big depending how you want to serve them.
Score the all the cookie sheets this usually make at least 2 sheets worth.
Place one sheet near the bottom of the oven and the other near the middle bake 20 minutes then trade sheet middle to bottom bottom to middle.
Bake 20 more minutes.
you should have 2 sheets of dark brown around the edges semi soft dog treats.
cook longer if you want them firmer.
remove from cookie sheet freeze all you will not use in 2 days place the rest in the fridge.
My dogs all love these.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.
In a large bowl, add pumpkin, coconut milk, vanilla extract and applesauce; mix until combined.
Add flour, baking powder, pumpkin spice and stevia to the pumpkin mixture; mix until combined.
Fold in raisins.
Drop large spoonfuls of the dough onto the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 12-17 minutes or until lightly golden.
To make glaze: Add powdered sugar, coconut milk and cinnamon into a bowl, whisk together and drizzle over warm biscuits.
Notes: For a sweeter biscuit, I highly recommend using about 1/4 cup of sugar.
These are best served right away.
If you are not going to eat the whole batch, I recommend freezing them for up to 3 months.
To warm, just take a biscuit out of the freezer and microwave for about 30 seconds or so.



In small bowl, combine all ingredients.
Shape into 3/4" balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet, flattening slightly.
Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove to wire rack to cool.



Wash and husk the strawberries.
In a food processor or blender, mash up the berries to your desired consistency-- sometimes I like a total complete puree, but pulsing a few times until mostly pureed with some fruit chunks still in it is also pretty good.
In a large mixing bowl, dump out the applesauce and mix with the strawberry puree.
Blend in the sugar and lemon juice.
Well-grease a 11x7 baking dish with cooking spray.
Pour the mixture into the dish.
Bake at 250F for 4-5 hours or until set.
Wait for it to cool.
Cut into bars, should yield about 10.
Wrap the bars tightly in plastic wrap and they will keep for about 2 weeks.



Combine the milk with the powdered milk and place in a medium saucepan.
You could add 1/3 C sugar and 1 T vanilla extract at this point for vanilla yogurt.
Heat the milk mixture to 180 degrees or until small bubbles form on the side of the pan and the milk begins to rise up (about 5 minutes.)
Pour the scalded milk into a pitcher and allow to cool to 100 degrees (about 50 minutes).
About half way through the cooling time, remove your yogurt from the refrigerator and allow to set out or it will shock the starter.
When the milk mixture has cooled to 100 degrees, stir in the yogurt starter.
Pour the yogurt into 4 pint jars and cover with lids.
Wrap the jars in a warm towel or blanket and place in your hay box or styrofoam cooler.
The jars should be snug without any room for air to move around inside the hay box.
Cover the hay box or styrofoam box with the lid.
Let the yogurt incubate in the box for 9 hours.
Remove the jars from the hay box and place in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
Note: You can add a couple of tablespoons of your favorite fruit jam in the bottom of the glass jars before pouring the unset yogurt mixture into the jars.



Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice and mix vigorously.
Stop when the shaker is too cold to hold.
Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with a lemon twist.



Peel and devein shrimp and cut chicken into 1 inch cubes.
Combine Garlic, Onion owder, Cumin and melted Butter.

Cook about 5 inches above hot coals, allowing 5 minutes for shrimp and 10 minutes for chicken.
Turn once or twice while cooking and baste often with remaining marinade.



Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, and heat oven to 350 degrees.
Put butter in an 8-inch square or 9-inch round pan; set in oven to melt.
When butter has melted, remove pan from oven.
Whisk flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, baking powder and salt in small bowl.
Add milk; whisk to form a smooth batter.
Pour batter into pan, then scatter fruit over batter.
Sprinkle with remaining 1 Tb.
of sugar.
Bake until batter browns and fruit bubbles, 50 to 60 minutes.
Serve warm or at room temperature with a dollop of whipped cream or a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired.



This recipie is for a small batch of jam.
It should make 2-3 250ml (8oz) jars, but its easy to double or triple.
1.5 lbs of fruit = 1/4 cup of sugar.
Wash and halve or quarter your apricots, and stick them in a covered container with the sugar and lemon juice and let macerate overnight in the fridge.
(You can skip this step, but it adds a richer deeper flavour.)
Pour the macerated fruit and the juices that its soaking in into a Dutch oven or a thick-bottomed pot, and bring to a simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, skimming the top if needed.
Depending on how chunky you want your jam, after about 15-20 minutes cooking time, the fruit should be starting to fall apart.
You can then mash it with a potato masher to make it a less chunky jam.
At this stage you might want to test its tartness; some people dont like a tart jam, and may want to add another 1/4 cup of sugar.
And then continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes until it reaches jam-like consistency, then spoon onto a cold plate to check if its finished.
Spoon the jam into hot sterilized jars, sealing immediately.
This is a nice tart jam, and goes well with toast, or in baked goods, or spooned over vanilla ice cream or yoghurt.



Heat oil in wok or large skillet until almost smoking.
Add garlic and beef, then scallops, and stir-fry about 30 seconds.
Add remaining ingredients and stir-fry beef and scallops another 20 to 30 seconds.



Put all the ingredients in a wok.
Mix well.
Switch on the gas.
Start rotating the mixture in a clockwise direction with the help of a'tavetha'.
Rotate the mixture continuously in the same direction.
After 5 minutes, the ghee will start binding the mixture.
In another 4-5 minutes, you will see globules of ghee on the edges.
Also, you will see the colour of the mixture turn to a light yellow.
Keep the flame on medium heat.
The mixture will start getting fluffy and bind together.
In the meantime,grease a moulding plate with a tsp.
or two of ghee.
Empty the contents of the wok on to the greased plate.
Sprinkle few drops of water on it.
Now the Mesub is ready and starts getting crystallised at the surface.
Sprinkle cardamom powder (to taste) on it.
Cut into diamond shaped pieces.
It is now ready to eat.
Store in an airtight container and use within one week.
I like to store mine refrigerated.
Cooking tip: For soft mesub, rotate the mixture in the same direction.



Preheat the oven to 350F.
Combine the flour and ginger with a whisk.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Add the sugar and golden syrup; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is dissolved.
Remove from heat; stir in the flour-ginger mixture.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with a Silpat (a French nonstick baking mat) or parchment.
Drop 6 even tablespoons batter on the Silpat about 2 inches apart; place in the oven.
Bake until flat and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Let the cookies cool 2 minutes, until slightly firm; immediately wrap them, 1 at a time, around a wide round wooden spoon handle, and let set for 30 seconds.
Transfer from the spoon handle to a cooling rack.
Repeat with the remaining batter.



Cut a small watermelon in half and quarter it.
Scoop the watermelon from each quarter with an ice cream scoop into a large glass measuring bowl until you have 4 cups.
If you dont have a large glass measuring bowl, scoop melon into a bowl and measure out the correct amount.
The glass measuring bowl just makes things easier.
Take a taste test for sweetness.
The sweetness of watermelons varies so much.
Adjust the amount of sugar accordingly.
Squeeze lemon juice into the measuring bowl with the melon pieces.
Sprinkle sugar on top and mix to incorporate.
Pour the melon mixture into your blender or food processor.
Pulse to break the pieces up well and then hit the puree button if you have one and process the ingredients until all the pieces of melon are completely gone.
Youre looking for a semi-smooth liquid.
You will not get a completely smooth liquid because of the texture of the watermelon.
Pour into a glass 9 x 13 baking pan.
Clear a shelf in your freezer and place the pan in.
I used the top shelf in my freezer and the granita froze quickly.
After one hour take the pan out of the freezer and break up the ice crystals with a fork.
Run your fork around the inside edges of the pan also to incorporate those frozen bits in with the rest of the mixture.
Do this two more times.
After the third time, transfer your frozen granita to an airtight container and freeze until ready to eat.
Enjoy!

Pour into an 8x8 dish and stick it in the fridge for about 5 minutes to firm it up.
Try to resist the urge to eat the scraps left in the bowl and on the beaterits still quite hot!
Let it cool, then eat the scraps.
Once the fudge is all nice and firm, its ready to eat!
Just cut it up into chunks.
I actually kinda like it cold, straight from the fridge, but you can let it sit on the counter for a few minutes if you like.

Mix until incorporated but not much more.
Do not overmix.
Pour 1/4 cup of the melted butter into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Spoon batter into pan.
Top batter with remaining 1/4 cup butter (I know-it looks like a GIANT sea of butter.
It will get absorbed as the bread cooks).
Bake for 50 minutes or until a wooden skewer comes out clean.

In a small bowl stir together the butter and the oil.
In a food processor fitted with a 1-millimeter slicing blade or with a mandoline or similar hand-held slicing device, slice the potatoes thin.
Working quickly to prevent the potatoes from discoloring, brush the bottom of a 9-inch cast-iron skillet with some of the butter mixture and cover it with a layer of the potato slices, overlapping them.
Brush the potatoes with some of the remaining butter mixture, sprinkle them with some of the rosemary, and season them with salt and pepper.
Layer the remaining potatoes with the remaining butter mixture and the rosemary in the same manner.
Heat the mixture over moderately high heat until it begins to sizzle, transfer the skillet to the middle of a preheated 450F oven, and bake the galette for 25 minutes, or until it is golden and the potatoes are tender.
Cut the galette into wedges.

Heat up your wok over low heat, and make sure its also completely dry.
Add oil and the peanuts.
Keep stirring continuously for about 15-20 minutes until the outsides start to get darker and the peanuts get really fragrant.
It may seem like a long time to stand at the stove stirring, but its totally worth it.
Add the sea salt, mix well and turn off the heat.
Let the peanuts cool completely (they get really hot during the cooking process, so handle with care).
After theyre cooled, the peanuts will have that great crunch that youre looking for.

Let simmer until liquid is absorbed.



This moist, finely textured crumb is like silk.
Preparation: bring the milk and egg yolks to room temperature.
Leave the egg whites in the refrigerator until it's ready to use.
Sift the flour, and then mix with a whisk.
*Tip 1: The reason for mixing the sifted flour with a whisk it to incorporate plenty of air.
It's just like sifting it twice, but easier.
*Tip 2: Eggs vary in size, so in order to create the same cake reliably every time, I weigh them.
Put a baking sheet in the oven, and preheat to 340F/170C.
To make the meringue: Beat the egg whites lightly with a handheld egg beater, then add all the sugar.
*Tip 3: The reason for adding the sugar all at once is to make it absorb as much of the moisture of the egg whites as possible, to create a soft, finely textured and sturdy meringue.
*Tip 4: It takes more time to whisk than adding the sugar in batches, but you can create a very finely textured, high quality meringue this way.
Start beating the egg whites and sugar at high speed, until the meringue forms very soft peaks.
Add the cornstarch (or lemon juice).
Beat at low speed to incorporate it evenly.
*Tip 5: Cornstarch absorbs the moisture of the egg whites and stabilizes the foamy texture of the meringue.
*Tip 6: Lemon juice and salt also make the meringue finely textured and stable.
When the meringue forms soft peaks as shown here, it's good.
*Tip 7: If you beat the meringue for too long so that it forms very stiff peaks, it's hard to incorporate the rest of the ingredients, and you end up losing some of the bubbles.
Make the yolk batter: Beat the yolks lightly to break them up, and add all the sugar at once.
Mix in low speed until the sugar is incorporated into the yolks.
*Tip 8: There's no need to whisk it until it's pale and thick.
You'll lose the incorporated air when you add the oil and milk anyway.
Add the oil, and beat it in.
Add the milk, and mix it in also.
If everything is well mixed as shown here, it's good.
Mix up the flour with a whisk again to incorporate more air, then add all the yolk batter.
Mix with a whisk until it is no longer floury.
When the batter is smooth and thick as shown here it's done.
Chiffon batter has a high moisture content, so you can beat it hard.
*Tip 9: Unlike regular spongecakes, if you beat it very well and develop the gluten in the flour, the cake will be not only be soft, it will be nice and bouncy too.
Mix up meringue with a whisk to incorporate any water, which may have seeped out.
Put a scoop of meringue into the batter and mix it in well with a whisk.
Don't worry about the air bubble disappearing.
*Tip 10:The first addition of meringue is a sacrifice, in order to make it easier to incorporate the rest into the batter.
It looks like this.
Change to a rubber spatula.
Add 1/3 of the remaining meringue, and fold it in to the batter, scooping up from the bottom.
and turning the bowl.
When it's just about mixed, incorporate 1/2 of the remaining meringue in the same way.
Finally, add the batter into the bowl with the rest of the meringue.
*Tip 11: From the 2nd addition of meringue onwards, work carefully so as not to lose the air bubbles as much as possible.
The batter now looks like this.
It's smooth, shiny and airy.
Pour the batter into the cake tin from about a 15cm height.
If you pour it from too high up, you'll create big air bubbles.
Hold the cake tin from both sides with the bottom on the countertop, and rotate it back and forth to smooth out the surface.
Don't hit the tin on your work surface as other cake recipes dictate.
*Tip 12: Hitting the cake tin onto a hard surface to eliminate air bubbles works for sturdy cake batters, but it doesn't work well for light batters, very creamy batters or batters with added ingredients like chocolate chips.
*Tip 13: With a very light soft batter like this one, even the smallest shock will pop some of the small bubbles, and you may even end up introducing large bubbles.
Put the cake in the oven and bake.
I baked the cake for 27 minutes.
The texture is moist and amooth, just like chiffon.
*Tip 14: If you bake it for 30 minutes, check for doneness with a bamboo skewer.
If it comes out clean, it's well baked and stable, so you can cover it with whipped cream.
*Tip 15: If you want to add fruits or chestnut cream after covering the cake with whipped cream, bake for 30 minutes at 360F/180C.
You'll have a firm cake that can withstand all that weight on top.
8 minutes into the baking time, take the cake out and make 5 1cm deep cuts spaced evenly over the surface of the cake.
This ensures that the cake will rise nice and evenly.
*Tip 16: This method is useful for ensuring that the cake cooks evenly too, especially when you want a firm texture.
*Tip 17: By taking it out of the oven you are cooking the cake that is just starting to rise, so it's important to work quickly.
*Tip 18: If this seems too difficult or rushed for you, or if you have a difficult batter to deal with such as a thin or very creamy one, just skip this step.
27 minutes into baking, if you poke the cake with a skewer, little bits of the sponge are on it.
This is fine.
*Tip 19: It's often written that if the skewer comes out clean the cake is done, but this actually means the cake is overdone.
The best method is to take it out just before the skewer comes out clean, and to let the cake continue cooking with residual heat.
*Tip 20: If you let it bake for 30 minutes, the skewer will come out clean.
** NOTE: If you're using a 20 cm diameter cake tin, bake for 37 to 40 minutes at 340F/170C.
It will puff up a lot, so be careful not to let it burn.
To prevent the cake from shrinking, drop the cake tin onto a counter top lined with a kitchen towel from about 15cm to eliminate the hot air.
Cool the cake upside down.
When the tin is just a little warm when you touch it, put the whole thing in a plastic bag and leave to rest overnight.
*Tip 21: By letting it rest overnight, the flavors will blend together.
It's delicious when it's freshly baked, but it may taste too sweet or not sweet enough.
*Tip 22: By resting the cake, the texture will firm up, so it becomes harder to mess up when removing the cake from the tin.
Remove the cake from the tin.
Insert a knife in between the cake and the tin, make a small gap and go around once with the knife while moving it up and down.
Go around the funnel in the middle with a metal or bamboo skewer, moving up and down while scraping against the funnel wall.
Grab the funnel and invert the cake.
Support the cake with the hand holding the funnel.
Insert a knife between the bottom and the cake, and go around once while scraping against the bottom.
Remove the hand that's holding on to the funnel, and it's done.
*Tip 23: The reason for using milk even though it's a plain chiffon cake is because the natural sweetness and fragrance of the milk softens the eggy-ness, and makes the cake taste delicious.
*Tip 24: If you are using water, use less than the milk.
10% of the milk volume is fat, which tends to toughen the crumb, so more milk is used than water.
*Tip 25: Castor sugar (sugar or 'baker's sugar') absorbs and retains moisture well, so it mixes well in batters and helps to create a cake that stays moist for a long time.

Heat cream gently in heavy-bottomed saucepan until it reaches 190 F, stirring to ensure the bottom doesnt scorch.
If you dont have a thermometer that is OK you will know youre at the right temperature when the cream is simmering very gently.
Add lemon juice to the cream and keep the mixture at 190 F (that gentle simmer) for 5 minutes while continuing to stir.
The cream will thicken up so that it coats the back of your spoon, but no visible curds will form.
Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow to cool for 30 minutes.
Once it has cooled, pour the cream into a sieve lined with four layers of cheesecloth and set over a bowl.
Allow the cream to drain, letting it cool completely.

Other supplies: 18 inches string or yarn or dental floss.
Adult job is to take a knife and make a small hole in the center of each piece of fruit and to cut the string.
Tie a piece of cereal to one end of the string and hand it over to the kids!
Kid job is to thread the cereal and fruit onto the string.
Knot the other end of the string into the first piece of cereal and tie it securely.
Wear your necklace when you are hiking and as you need a snack, nibble from your necklace.
Note: I recommend not using candies such as life savers in this because they get so sticky when the kids start eating the necklace and it seems to create a bigger mess and bugs too!



Combine all ingredients except evaporated milk in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the liquid is fairly thick.
Puree in a blender, then pour the blended liquid through a strainer.
Add evaporated milk.
Chill.
Then follow your ice cream maker's instructions for freezing.
I have put this in a shallow tray, freeze it until it isn't quite solid, then beat it in a chilled bowl and beaters, return it to the tray, cover with plastic or foil, and freeze.
It can be hard to scoop, though, so the ice cream freezer works best.



Measure sauce ingredients together.
Bring to a simmer.
If using as a marinade, let cool.
If using as a mop, use immediately.
Can be thickened, if desired.
Gumbo file works just great, the sassafras adds a nice touch.



Using a large pot, heat the milk to about 195-200 F (~91- 94 C).
This is for two reasons:.
One: It kills any other bacteria that might be in the milk that would compete against the bacteria that convert milk to yogurt.
Two: It changes the milk protein in a way that allows it to culture and firm up.
Let it cool down to 110-115F (43-46C).
Wisk in the yogurt culture into the milk gently.
Transfer into the yogurt jars and close the lids.
Wrap jars in a thick blanket or put in a ice cooler isolated with a blanket over night.
After 6-8 hours the yogurt should be firm.
Test by gently turning it to see if it keeps its shape.
Transfer jars to the refrigerator.



Melt butter in pan and add the rest of the ingredients.
Stir occasionally.
Keep warm.



Preheat oven to 400F (200C).
Grease baking sheets.

About 1 hour.



Combine the milk, yogurt, salt and sugar in a saucepan.
Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a whisk.
As the milk is just about to boil (it will bubble at the edges), stir in the lemon juice.
Remove from the heat and pour into a sieve lined with cheesecloth.
Lift the cheesecloth by the four corners and tie them together.
Hang the cheese in the cloth over the sink to drain.
It will take 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Once drained, place the cheese, still in the cloth, into a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.
If later you want to cut the paneer into firm fingers, use a spoon to press the paneer into the shape of the bowl before refrigerating.



Mix lowfat milk and powdered lowfat milk together in a heavy kettle.
Then cover and heat slowly to 180 degrees.
Using a heat distributor under the kettle and stirring occasionally will help prevent scorching.
Remove from heat and cold to about 125 to 130 degrees.
Then mix about 1/2 c. of the hot lowfat milk with 1/2 c. of plain yogurt in a small bowl.
Doing this will help assure an even distribution of the yogurt.
Then stir this mix into the kettle of lowfat milk.
Cover the kettle.
Now get a couple of heavy blankets and lay them out nice in a quiet spot on your kitchen counter.
Set the kettle in the middle of the blankets and wrap it up well so it retains the heat.
You may set a towel under the kettle if you are concerned about spills.
Don't disturb for 3-4 hrs.
then carefully check to see if it is done.
Gently touch the surface with a spoon.
If it is hard, or possibly if it is solid but has a bit of clear yellowish liquid on the surface, it is done.
Then unwrap it and cold completely before eating.
If it doesn't seem done, rewrap and let it set another hour or possibly so.
Try not to let it set too long or possibly it tends to get sour, but it is still usable even though you may not like it as well.
This recipe can be reduced in size if 1 gallon sounds like too much.
This yogurt has a much more pleasant flavor than plain yogurt from the store.
And you may use this yogurt for your starter for your next batch instead of buying another carton.

Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball.
If there is still flour in the bottom of the bowl, dribble in additional water.
The dough should feel soft and supple.
It is better for it to be a little too soft than to be too stiff and tough.
Sprinkle high-gluten or whole-wheat flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook).
Add more flour if needed to make a firm, supple dough that is slightly tacky but not sticky.
Kneading should take about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine).
The dough should pass the windowpane test (page 58)and register 77 to 81F.
Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
Ferment at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.
Remove the dough from the bowl and press it by hand into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick, 6 inches wide, and 8 to 10 inches long.
Form it into a loaf, as shown on page 81.
Place the loaf in a lightly oiled 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch bread pan.
Mist the top with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap.
Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes, or until the dough crests above the lip of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 350F with the oven rack on the middle shelf.
Place the bread pan on a sheet pan and bake for 30 minutes.
Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven.
The finished loaf should register 190F in the center, be golden brown on the top and the sides, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.
When the bread is finished baking, remove it immediately from the loaf pan and cool it on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.
Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast
10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 1/2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking
This is one formula that is not greatly improved by the preferment or sponge technique.
Because it is made by the direct dough method, though, this formula is especially good for bread machines.

Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor.
Turn the machine on and add the olive oil through the feed tube, followed by 1 cup water.
Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, a little at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch.
If dry, add another tablespoon or two of water and process for another 10 seconds.
(In the unlikely event that the mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.)
Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and, by hand, knead in either the rosemary or the olives or both (or neither).
Form a smooth, round dough ball, put this in a bowl, and cover with plastic wrap; let rise until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours.
(You can cut this rising time short if you are in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 6 or 8 hours.)
Proceed to step 3 or wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to a month.
(Defrost in a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature.)
When the dough is ready, form it into a ball and divide it into 2 pieces if you like or leave whole; roll each piece into a round ball.
Place each ball on a lightly floured surface, sprinkle with a little flour, and cover with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let rest until the dough puffs slightly, about 20 minutes.
Pinch the bottom of the ball(s) to seal the seam as best you can.
Sprinkle all over with flour and let rise on a well-floured (or use cornmeal) peel or baking sheet, covered, for at least an hour and preferably longer, up to 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 425F.
Slash the top several times with a razor blade (you can make a pattern if you like).
Put the baking sheet directly into the oven or slide the dough from the peel onto a pizza stone on a rack set low in the oven.
Bake until the loaves are beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 375F.
(If necessary, adjust the oven heat so the breads brown evenly.)
Bake until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature of the bread is at least 210F, 40 to 60 minutes total.
Remove and cool on a wire rack.
You can make this with olives, too, but omit the rosemary: In step 2, knead 1 large onion, minced, into the dough in place of or along with the olives.
Add, if you like, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves.
A standard in North Africa: Substitute 2 cups fine semolina flour for 2 cups of the white flour.
Instead of forming the dough into loaves, roll or press it into large rounds (at least 10 inches in diameter), as you would pizza (page 572).



Preheat the broiler.
Coat a large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the butter, bread crumbs, parsley, oregano, and garlic; mix well.

Bake about 1 hour and cool on racks.
To get a really good crust spray the loaves with water 3 times in the first 15 minutes of baking.



Dissolve the yeast in a small amount of water or, if you are using dry yeast, bloom the yeast as the package instructs.
Using the 1 or 2 setting on your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment in place, add the water and yeast to the bowl of your mixer.
Add the rest of the ingredients.
Once the dough is formed to a smooth dough, turn it out onto your work surface.
Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover and place in a warm draft free location.
When the dough has doubled in size, punch the dough down by pushing your fist into the center of the dough.
Let it rise again and take it out of the bowl.
Separate into 3 1-pound loaves.
You can place the loaves into loaf pans if you like.
Let the bread proof until doubled in size again.
Putting them in an oven that has not been turned on is a good place for this.
Take the proofed loaves out of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
I like to egg wash the bread and then slash it, but you can skip the wash if you like.
Bake until golden brown.

Place superfine sugar in a shallow dish.
Add the cranberries, rolling to coat with sugar.
Spread sugared cranberries in a single layer on a baking sheet; let stand at room temperature for 1 hour or until dry.
Note: The steeping liquid clings to the berries and helps the sugar adhere.
Store in an airtight container in a cool place for up to a week.



Gently heat the strawberries in just enough water to prevent them from sticking on the pan.
Once the juices from the strawberries have started to come out, depending on the size of the strawberries you can either mash them or leave them whole.
Then add the jam sugar to the pan and on a gentle heat, stir it in and let it dissolve.
Once the pan starts to boil, turn the temperature up and bring the pan (whilst stirring) to a rolling boil.
Generally you will only need to let it boil fully for a few minutes.
Check to see if it has reached setting point.
I do this by using the wrinkle test: put a couple of small plates in the fridge and when you think that the jam is at setting point, take the pan off the heat and put a small amount onto one of the plates and put it back in the fridge for a minute, then take it out and push it from one side to the other with a finger.
If it 'wrinkles' it has reached setting point; if it just separates you need to get that rolling boil going again for another minute and repeat the test until setting point is reached.
Leave the jam to cool for a few minutes stirring every now and then before bottling up.
Stirring will make sure that the fruit is evenly dispersed through the jam and not just floating on top.
Bottle into sterilised jars (wash in warm soapy water then pop into an oven at 160C for 20 minutes and 5 minutes for the lids).
I don't use a jam funnel as I much prefer using a measuring jug as that way I am able to see how far up the jar the jam is.
Fill to within 2-3mm of the top of the jar and put the lid on straight away - this gives a nice vacuum seal to the jar.



Season chicken on both sides with salt, pepper, and cumin.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Cook chicken until browned on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Squeeze grapes to separate pulp from skins.
Boil pulp 5 minutes, then strain to remove seeds.
Add skins to pulp and boil 10 minutes.
Combine cornstarch and sugar, mixing until well blended.
Add this to grape mixture along with the lemon juice, bringing to a boil again and cooking until thick.
Cool.
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix oats, flour and brown sugar.
Cut in butter until crumbly.
Press half of this mixture into a greased 8x8-inch baking pan.
Spread with grape mixture.
Top with remaining oat mixture.
Bake 45 minutes until golden.



Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water and leave for 5 minutes.
While waiting, sift the flour into your mixing bowl.
Add the salt & oil.
Once a foam has formed on the yeasty water pour it in and start mixing.
Add more water as required (varies depending on climate, humidity etc.)
until the dough feels like a young woman's breast.
I was taught this by a baker many years ago and while it sounds rude, it really is the easiest way to describe how a good dough should feel.
Now clean your mixing bowl.
This next part, while not vital, does make a noticeable difference.
Rub oil around the surface of the dough, put it in your clean mixing bowl and stick it in the fridge.
Leave it there for as long as possible (24 hours is best but 6 hours is ok).
If you don't have time for the fridge don't stress - just skip it and move on.
If you used the fridge you will have noticed your dough rose, albeit slowly.
Take your dough out of the fridge and let it rise some more.
Once risen pound the crap out of it to flatten it again but don't knead it too much.
Cut your dough into 3 or 4 balls, roll them flat, fold them up and roll them again.
This creates air pockets which expand giving your base the authentic 5 star Italian wood-fired look and feel in the comfort of your own home.
If the dough begins to feel tough while you're working it, let it rest for 5 minutes.
It's just the gluten tightening up and resting it relaxes it.
Top your bases and cook for 10 minutes or so.
If you make thicker bases it often pays to partly cook the base for 5 min then top and bake again.
Enjoy!

pour out a little of the juice so there's room, pour the yeast and 1 1/2 cups sugar in, top back up with apple juice but leave at least an inch of room at the top.
replace the lid and shake well to dissolve yeast and sugar as much as possible.
stretch a balloon over the top of the jug instead of the lid, poke a few holes in the top of the balloon with a pin.
this is your air lock.
it will allow CO2 to escape without letting bacteria inches i like to wrap string or a rubber band around the balloon to keep it firmly in place and sealed.
set in a closet or basement and ignore for a month.
when you come back your balloon will be somewhat limp (rather then rigid and puffed up like it's been when you've been checking on it, oh yes you have) and your brew should be back to as clear as it was before you added things.
if you used store brand apple juice it should be clear, if organic it will still be somewhat cloudy, either way there should be a clear separation from the sediment at the bottom.
either carefully pour out your cider, leaving the sediment at the bottom, or siphon out.
add as much of the remaining sugar as pleases your taste buds, at least 1/4 cup though or it won't carbonate.
wash out some pop bottles really well, this looks ghetto but they were designed to handle the pressure of carbonation and wine bottles could explode.
if you want to be really pro you can get proper beer bottles and stuff, i just don't serve in these.
pour your brew into the bottles, try not to leave them half full, you'll need one two liter and one 500ml bottle, unless you spill a bunch while siphoning, like i did.
seal the lids on well and let sit for another week to mellow and carbonate, chill and drink!
it will mellow more as it ages but i wouldn't let it go more then a year.



Mix together all ingredients.
Make flat patties with your hands, then grill over low heat in a Teflon pan.

Once active, add the olive oil, honey, salt and oatmeal.
Then add 4 cups of whole wheat flour.
Put the dough hook on the mixer and mix.
Once all the liquid is incorporated, keep adding flour to the dough until it comes away from the sides of the bowl, and forms a ball.
(You can also knead this by hand.
But I am lazy.
The dough hook works great!)
Take the dough and put it in a greased large bowl.
Cover with a cloth towel and put in a warm dry place to rise.
I put mine in the oven with the oven light on.

Start this cheese in the evening.
Maintain the milk at 90 degrees F in a double boiler.
Mix the buttermilk and yogurt separately with a little of the milk to remove lumps, then blend into the rest of the milk.
Add the rennet solution and mix thoroughly.
Let sit until the curd sets and breaks clearly when tested with a finger - about 20 to 30 minutes.
Cut the curd into 1/2 inch cubes as evenly as possible.
Maintain at 90 degrees F for 15 minutes, stirring with a clean hand.
The curds are fragile because they have not been cooked, so stir very gently, just enough to keep them from matting together.
Gently pour the curds into a cloth lined colander.
When the whey has drained, the curd should be in one solid piece.
Rinse in cold water, then soak in a pan of cold water for 15 minutes.
If it is a big batch, cut the curd into several blocks, 4 or 5 inches square.
Drain off most of the water, then refrigerate the curds, or keep in a cool, 40 degrees F place.
Leave them in a colander or other container that allows drainage.
The next day, warm the cheese to room temperature so it will ripen, or become more acidic.
After an hour or so, test the cheese for acidity as follows.
Cut off a small piece of cheese and cut it into three 1/2 inch cubes.
Heat several cups of water in a sauce pan to 165 degrees F.
Put in the cubes and stir for 5 minutes.
Remove the cubes and mold them together like modeling clay.
Reheat the lump of cheese in the water for a minute, then remove and work or mold it together a little more.
After repeating several times, try to pull the curd apart.
If it breaks or tears, and clouds the water, it is underripe.
Wait an hour or so and test again.
When it pulls into a long rope and can be molded together again, it is ready.
It will have a glossy surface and* will cloud the water only slightly.
The whole cheese is treated somewhat like the test sample to finish it.
Cut it into small cubes and put them in a pan.
Heat water to 170 degrees F and pour enough over them, to cover the curds by about 2 inches.
Keep a thermometer in the pan and let the temperature drop to 135 degrees F.
Press the cubes together, and then knead the cheese, by stretching and pulling it, as if working modelling clay.
It should become "plastic" and stretch into long strands.
When it does, shape into half pound balls, or make a thick rope, fold it in half, and twist several times to make a decorative oblong cheese.

Combine the ingredients.
Store in a sealed, labeled container or baggie with the directions to make the cake.
(This mix will fit in a quart-size baggie, just barely.)
If you want to double, triple, or more the mix to make in bulk and keep it all in one big container, stir the mix well and measure out 5 cups of mix each time you make a cake (or a bit more if you used cake flour).
To replace in recipes calling for a store-bought white cake mix: Use in any recipe calling for a white cake mix as a base (add 1 teaspoon vanilla to the recipe along with the cake mix as the recipe will assume powdered vanilla flavoring was included in the store-bought mix).
Or to make a basic white cake using your homemade mix, use the following instructions : 1 recipe Homemade White Cake Mix + 1 1/4 cups water + 1/2 cup shortening + 4 egg whites + 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Combine all the ingredients.
Beat to mix on low, then beat on high for two minutes.
Pour into greased, floured cake pans.

Baking Time : 8 or 9 cake rounds 20-25 minutes / 13 x 9 pan 35-40 minutes / cupcakes 12-15 minutes / tube/bundt pan 45-50 minutes.
To make this mix without using powdered milk: Delete the dried milk from the mix ingredients.
When preparing the cake, replace the 1 1/4 cups water with 1 1/3 cups milk or buttermilk.
Ive also used coconut milk with this recipe.
You can use any kind of milk you want.
Just remember that recipes calling for a store-bought white cake mix are going to assume the mix contains powdered milk.
Also remember, if you make the mix in bulk, instead of measuring out 5 cups per cake, youd measure out 4 1/2 cups (to make up for the 1/2 cup powdered milk thats not in there).

In a 10" bowl or bigger add the 2 1/4 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and blend or mix well with a fork and set it to the side -- we will call this the dry mix --
In a smaller pre-warmed bowl mix the 3/4 cups of warm water, the 1/4 oz.
packet of yeast, 2 teaspoons of white granulated sugar and the 1 teaspoon of salt.
Now stir the wet mix well and let it set for 8 - 10 minutes to allow the yeast to start activating -- If it grows a head of foam a beer could only dream of in that time, you did it correctly.
After waiting the 8 - 10 minutes mentioned above, combine the 2 mixes (Wet and Dry), and blend just until the bread quits sticking to the bowl and stop mixing -- The dough should look stringy and not be completely blended together.
At this time dump the dough onto a clean, dry and lightly floured work area.
Wash your hands as you wash the 10" bowl that you will need again in a moment -- dry the bowl and flour your hands.
At this time add 4 tablespoons of the olive oil -- yes just pour it on top of the dough and kneed the bread until a nice doughball is formed -- Most of the kneeding is done at this time so mash and fold -- mash and fold.alot.
After a nice doughball is formed, oil the 10" bowl with 1/2 the remaining olive oil and place the doughball in the bowl flipping the dough until it is coated well with the oil -- (This keeps the the dough from stiffening up while it is rising.)
Cover the bowl and place in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size -- (on a warm day it should take roughly an hour, on a cold and rainy day it may take up to 3 hours).
After the dough has doubled in size dump the dough onto your lightly floured surface then kneed and double fold the dough 4 times and stop kneeding .
Reform and oil the ball with the last remaining tablespoon of olive oil and place back into the bowl and allow the dough to rise again until it has doubled in size a second time.
After it has risen the second time punch down the dough and dump the doughball back onto your lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the doughball lightly with flour and roll out the dough to roughly form a 10" to 12" square --
On this square pour the melted butter and spread evenly to cover the top of the dough square.
Now lightly cover the buttered area with a light coating of cinnamon and the left over brown sugar.
Now add the pecan pieces on top of the brown sugar if you so choose.
Now roll the dough into a log and take a serrated bread knife and CUT the dough into 1" wide sections -- (DO NOT just mash through the dough with the knife) -- Now place the rounds on a non-stick or pam coated baking pan and allow them to rise again -- basically until they have doubled in size again.

Repeat until all of the liquid is strained.
Store the milk in the fridge for up to 4 days, and you can even use the almond pieces for salads, in oatmeal or breads...be creative!

Cut away the lower 4th of the asparagus and peel the stalk.
This way the entire spear is edible will cook more quickly and at the same rate.

Melt and temper the chocolate (see pages 2530).
Dip each square into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely.
With a dipper or fork, remove the square from the chocolate, carefully shake off the excess chocolate, and turn the square out onto the paper.
Repeat with the remaining squares.
After dipping 4 squares, center a whole hazelnut on each square, pointed end up, before the chocolate sets up.
Press lightly on the hazelnut so that it will adhere.
Let the chocolate set up at room temperature, or chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
When the squares are set, place them in paper candy cups.
In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the squares will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer.
These squares are best served at room temperature.
Substitute any nuts for the hazelnuts.
These squares are also delicious without the chocolate coating.

Pour the milk into your crockpot.
Heat until it's at 180 degrees; keep track of the time as you'll never have to check the temperature again after you make it the first time!
In my crockpot, it takes about 3 hours on high.
Turn off the crockpot and let milk cool to 1110-120 degrees (again; time it).
In my crockpot, this takes about 3 1/2 hours.
Scoop a cup or so of your warm milk into a bowl or a large measuring cup.
Add the 1/2 cup starter yogurt (probably a good idea to let that warm up to room temperature though I don't always bother).
Whisk the milk and yogurt and then whisk all into the crockpot.
"Swaddle" the crockpot in blankets or towels to keep the heat inches Let it sit for 8-12 hours.
That's it!
Notes: You can take 1/2 cup of this yogurt and put it in a baggie or another container.
Place it in the freezer.
Pull it out when you start your next batch of yogurt and it'll be defrosted and ready to use as your next starter.
I put the finished yogurt into wide-mouth quart jars, and bought a wide-mouth funnel on line to make that job easier.
You can make thicker yogurt by draining some of the whey out (use a coffee filter placed in a small sieve or cheesecloth).
If you drain long enough, it thickens to cream cheese consistency.
You may have to purchase yogurt every 5th or 6th time.
For some reason, the starter tends to lose its potency.
I add a little bit of dried milk to my regular milk to increase the calcium (plus I think it thickens it a bit more).
Enjoy!

When butter has been "burned" remove the saucepan from the heat.
Slowly mix in confectioners' sugar and vanilla.
Beat on high speed of an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Beat in the milk a tablespoon at a time until desired spreading consistency is achieved.
Use frosting immediately, as this frosting will set up quickly.



In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and the black pepper.

Do not saute the shallots.
Combine with the crumbs and other ingredients and toss lightly.
Add more melted butter if needed, and taste for seasoning.
Stuff the bird lightly just before roasting.
Instead of tarragon you can use any of the following herbs to taste.
(It is better not to mix herbs, except for the addition of parsley, but mix if you must.)
1.
About 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, soaked in a little white wine for an hour.
2.
Sage.
Use with discretion, or it smothers all other flavors.
3.
Summer savory.
This has a delicious flavor for turkey and is less known than most herbs.
4.
Basil.
The fresh is delicious and superb in the stuffing of a spitted bird.
If fresh is not available, use about 2 teaspoons of dried basil, soaked in white wine beforehand.
Another way to give the flavor of fresh basil to your dressing is by adding pesto , the Italian sauce normally used with pasta.
Fortunately, it freezes rather well, so pesto can be made when fresh basil is in the market or in your herb garden and it is possible to have it with your Thanksgiving or Christmas bird.
Add about 3 tablespoons of pesto or more to the basic bread stuffing.
You will have to reduce the amount of crumbs, depending upon the quantity of additive.
1.
1 1/2 to 2 cups coarsely broken cooked chestnuts (These may be purchased in tins).
2.
1 cup or more toasted salted filberts.
3.
1 cup or more toasted unbalanced almonds.
4.
1 cup or more salted pecan halves.
5.
1 1/2 to 2 cups toasted walnut halves.
6.
2 cups finely diced celery.
This makes a delicious change in the basic stuffing and is also good in goose.
7.
1 1/2 cups of finely diced fennel bulb.
Omit any other herb save parsley.
8.
A head of finely shredded Boston lettuce.
Added to the basic stuffing at the last minute, this is surprisingly good.
You may find you need additional salt.
9.
Giblets.
Chop the gizzard and heart very fine; reserve the liver.
Saute the gizzard and heart with the onions just enough to color them, then mix with the rest of the ingredients.
Use the liver in the sauce later.
Saute it lightly in butter and chop exceedingly fine before adding.



In medium bowl, combine oats, yogurt, pineapple and almonds, mix well.

Pour the heavy whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla extract into a large bowl, and whisk using a large balloon whisk.
Whisk for approximately 35 minutes, until the cream reaches the soft peak stage.
First you will notice the cream form large bubbles on top, then the bubbles will disappear and the cream will start to form ridges.
You can test for soft peaks by lifting the whisk straight out of the bowl, inverting it, and seeing that a peak falls ever so slightly to the side.
Enjoy!
Whipped cream can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple hours.



Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) Butter an 8 inch square baking dish.

In a heavy medium sized saucepan - put in 1 cup sugar and the butter.
Melt over low-medium heat.
Add water.
Stir frequently.
Using a candy thermometer, cook to 300 degrees F. This should take approximately 15-20 minutes.
When the mixture has reached 300 degrees, pour into prepared pan.
This will - of course- be very hot!
Put the pan on a heatproof surface.
If the mixture does not spread out evenly, use a heat-proof spatula to spread out the mixture to an even layer.
It does not have to be perfect, and the thick pieces will taste just fine!
When you are finished spreading the mixture, sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the top of the HOT mixture.
These chips will melt very quickly, then smooth them over the top of the toffee mixture with a spatula (don't mix!)
As soon as the chocolate has set (cooled slightly) sprinkle lightly with the pecans.
Tap the pan against the counter to "set" the nuts.
Let cool.

Pack in jars/containers.
To make pie, make crust and bake.
Into prepared crust, put thawed filling and bake till warmed through.
Crumb topping can be added before baking filling if you want (I use sugar, cinnamon, margarine and minced pecans.)
I found which the thickener
(the flour, water, etc.
mix which is cooked first) made a lot more than could be used up by 24 c of apples.
I think I got a total of 8-10 large containers (I use empty 32 ounce yogurt containers).
One of these containers was just sufficient for a 9 in pie.
I also used (do not tell anybody) prepared pie shells just fine with this filling.
I also used a large nonstick pot to cook this in and had very little problem with sticking at medium to medium high temperature.

Add the yeast and mix.
Let this mixture sit for about 5 minutes.
Add 1 cup of flour and the olive oil and mix until well blended.
Add the rest of the flour (and any other additions) and mix well.
The dough should turn into a ball.
If the dough does not ball up because it's too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it does.
If your mixture is more like a batter, add flour one tablespoon at a time.
Adding water or flour as needed to get the right consistency will assure you always get a perfect dough.
Just remember to do it in small amounts.
Once the dough is balled up, place the ball on a floured board and knead for about a minute.
This builds the gluten which helps the dough to rise and become fluffy when cooked.
Place the dough in a plastic grocery bag or a covered bowl and store in a warm, dry area to rise.
After about 45 minutes the dough should have about doubled in size.
Punch down the dough so it deflates.
Let it rise for another hour to an hour and a half.
The dough is now ready to be rolled out.

Make an ice ring by filling a ring-shaped cake pan (or bundt pan) about half full with 1/2 liter of ginger ale.
Place in freezer until partially frozen (about 1 hour).
Once partially frozen, remove the pan from the freezer.
At this point you can place EDIBLE flowers or fruit slices around the ring, if you wish.

Stir gently with the ladle or wodden spoon.
Let the frozen ice ring float on top of the punch.
NOTE - The ice ring is made of ginger ale, not water.
So it will not only keep the punch chilled, but it will also enhance the flavor of the punch (and wont water down the punch after meltinglike plain ice cubes would tend to do).

After flour is mostly incorporated, bring speed up to a low-med (2 on a KA P600, or 4 on a KA Artisan).
I like a little stickier dough, so often the 4 cups of bread flour is enough for me.
If you need to add more flour, add the remaining 1/4 cup a tbsp at a time.
Knead with the dough hook on low-med (2 on a KA P600, or 4 on a KA Artisan) for 8 minutes.
Remove dough to a large bowl that has been oiled to prevent sticking.
Flip over to oil other side as well.
Cover with plastic wrap and set in your oven with only the pilot light or oven light bulb on for a draft free rising with a little warmth.
Let rise for 1-1 1/2 hours.
Dough should double or a little more.
I also place my empty bread pan in the oven during rising to warm a bit.
Remove dough from the bowl and pat gently into a narrow rectangle on a clean countertop.
You want the width to be about the same as the length of your bread pan.
Starting at one of the short ends, roll the dough into a log.
Tuck under the ends, and place into a lightly greased bread pan (I use a spritz of cooking spray).
Spray or lightly oil a piece of plastic wrap and drape loosely over loaf.
Place back in oven to rise another 20-30 minutes.
Remove pan from oven and set aside in a draft free place while you preheat your oven to 375 degrees.

Other equipment: unbleached all-purpose flour for kneading, sesame seeds (optional), cornmeal, tray of hot water, razor blade, sheetpan, parchment and Dough scraper.
Starter Dough: In a small bowl, mix the yeast in the lukewarm water (do the baby's bottle test on your wrist) and make sure that it bubbles (about 10 minutes).
In a bowl large enough for the starter dough to triple, transfer the yeast-water mixture, add the flour a half a cup at a time mixing it in well with a wooden spoon.
When the ingredients have been thoroughly combined, the Starter Dough will be quite soupy.
Let the Starter Dough rise, covered, in a no-draught spot on the counter (at room temperature) for 7 to 10 hours.
Bread: To make the dough, add 1/2 cup of flour to the Starter Dough.
Stir with a wooden spoon.
Continue to add all but 1/2 cup of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring all the time.
(Note: To make a more rustic bread, use 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c white flour).
You don't have to add all the flour.
You know it's enough when the dough comes away from the side of the bowl.
It will still be quite sticky.
Dust your board or counter with some of the last 1/2 c flour and then scrape the dough out of the bowl.
Sprinkle salt over top.
Use the extra flour to help you handle the wet dough.
Using a dough scraper when the dough sticks to the surface, knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes until it is smooth and silky (it should feel like your ear lobe when done).
Scrape away any dough that is on the board.
As you knead, add flour a very little at a time to stop it from sticking.
The dough will still be quite loose.
Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl.
Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a no-draught place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
When the dough has doubled, deflate the dough by pushing down on it with your fist and turn it out onto the board.
Divide it in two equal pieces.
Sprinkle or Sift a fine coating of flour on the work surface.
Place one ball of dough on the surface and gently pat it down to an even thickness of 1 inch.
Do not attempt to deflate every air bubble.
Using the heels and palms of your hands, flatten the dough into a crude rectangle measuring about 1 inch thick.
Fold the long side farthest from you a little over 2/3 of the way toward you.
Using the heel of your hand, gently press the folded edge to seal the dough.
Pick up the dough and turn it 180 degrees.
Fold over the other long edge of the dough about 2/3 of the way, and seal with the palm of your hand.
To make a compact cylinder easy to roll into a baguette shape, use both hands to fold the log in half lengthwise.
This time, as you fold, press your thumbs gently inside the fold to create tension on the surface of the log.
Using your fingertips, press the edges together to seal the dough into a taut cylinder.
This will produce a visible seam running the length of the dough.
To roll the dough into a baguette shape, place both hands on the center of the log with your fingers spread apart.
Using light uniform pressure, gently roll the dough back and forth into a long snake.
Taking care not to stretch the dough, move your hands from the center of the dough to the ends as the loaf begins to lengthen to about 14- 16 inches.
If the dough resists rolling, let it rest for 5 minutes before continuing.
Put the baguette seam side down on a baking pan that has cornmeal (or parchment) sprinkled on the bottom of the pan.
Optional: Wet your hands well and rub the dough.
Sprinkle sesame seeds over each baguette.
Repeat forming process with the other piece of dough.
Cover sheetpan with plastic wrap then a damp towel and let rise again to almost double (about 45 minutes).
Thirty minutes before you are going to bake, turn oven to 500F and Put water into a broiling pan and place it on the bottom rack of the oven.
Slash the top of the baguettes with a very sharp knife or razor blade horizontally across the loaf at a slight angle- make cuts at 2-3- inch intervals.
Spray the baguettes liberally with water.
Put bread in oven and immediately turn the oven down to 450F.
Bake the bread on the second lowest rack for 30 minutes or until it is hollow sounding on the bottom.
The bread will be done when the internal temperature reaches 200 degrees.
Turn off the oven.
leave the finished bread in the oven and leave with the door ajar for 5 or 10 minutes.
Remove to cool on cooling racks.
Wait until the bread is cool before cutting it.

Peel the fresh ginger and slice it as thinly as possible, cutting crosswise against the fibers.
Put the ginger slices in a large saucepan, add water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Decrease the heat to medium-low and simmer for 3 minutes.
Drain the ginger and repeat this step twice more.
You will have blanched the ginger slices a total of 3 times.
After the third draining, return the ginger to the saucepan and attach a candy thermometer to the side.
Add the 3 cups (750 ml) water, 3 cups (600 g) sugar, salt, and corn syrup, if using, and cook until the liquid reaches 225F (110C).
Remove from the heat and let the ginger rest in the syrup for 1 hour.
Place the ginger slices in a strainer and stir a few times to make sure as much syrup drips off as possible.
(If you wish, save the syrup for another use, such as for sweetening lemonade or mixing with sparkling water and fresh lime juice.)
Spread the ginger slices out on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and allow to dry for 2 to 3 hours.
Spread the remaining 1 cup (200 g) sugar on a baking sheet.
Place the ginger slices in the sugar and toss with your fingers to separate the pieces and coat them well with sugar.
Lift out the slices and shake off the excess sugar with your hands or place them in a colander and shake well.
Set the sugar-coated ginger slices on the wire rack and let dry overnight at room temperature.
The candied ginger will keep in an airtight container for up to 6 months.
The ginger can also be left in its syrup, without draining and tossing in sugar, and kept for a similar length of time in the refrigerator.
In the candying process, ginger slices or citrus peels are cooked in a thick sugar syrup to preserve them.
But, over time, the sugar has a tendency to recrystallize, causing the ginger or citrus peel to dry out a bit.
Adding a bit of corn syrup inhibits this recrystallization.
(Most other liquid sweeteners, like honey and maple syrup, dont behave the same way, so theyre not interchangeable for corn syrup.)
Ive made the corn syrup optional, so you can decide whether to use it.



To make the cakes, first preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, combine the brown rice and hazelnut flours, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate bowl, combine the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, and water.

Pour into 12 paper-lined 2 3/4-inch cupcake tins or 6 ungreased 5-inch rame-king.
For cupcakes, bake for 30 minutes.
For larger cakes, bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake bounces back after gently pressing a finger into the top.
Let cool while you make the frosting.
To make the frosting, in a double boiler or using a metal bowl placed on top of a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate.
When the chocolate is completely melted, transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
Add the coconut oil, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon, and beat on medium speed to combine.
Place the mixing bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill the frosting.
When cool, scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat again on high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.

Melt the margarine in a large pot and saute the chopped onions on medium heat.
While theyre sauteing, start peeling, cutting up your potatoes.
Once the onions have turned clear, add the potatoes, chicken broth, and cumin.
Stir and bring to a boil.
Then cover, reduce heat to medium, and allow the potatoes to cook until they soften enough to eat (about 20 minutes).
After the potatoes have cooked, remove the pot from the heat and add the chopped jalapeno, a pinch of baking soda, and the evaporated milk.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher (or a large fork if you dont have a potato masher) while theyre still in the pot.
Stir thoroughly and add the salt and pepper.
Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often.
Note that 2 tablespoons of jalapeno is spicy.
Adjust more or less to your taste.
I have used both fresh and canned jalapenos; fresh does give a better flavor, but canned works perfectly fine.
I do think canned gives a bit more spice though!

Move straws onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 15 minutes, until light brown.
Watch carefully, as overly browned straws aren't tasty.
Cool on a rack.
Notes: Every oven is different.
Cook the first batch, watching carefully, and if too brown, reduce heat to 325 degrees.
Rotate pan halfway through baking time.
Use more than one baking sheet at a time only if the sheets may be placed in the oven without overlapping.
Air must freely circulate or the bottoms will be burned and the tops unbrowned.
Switch shelves and positions of the pans as necessary to prevent top or bottom from browning.
Take care: white cheese will not brown as much as yellow.
Once the aroma comes wafting out of the oven, they are usually done.
Cooking further may burn the cheese.
Remove with a metal spatula to cool on a rack.
These keep several days at room temperature in a tightly sealed container, or frozen up to 3 months.
Due to the heavy humidity in the South, it may be necessary to re-crisp straws on a baking sheet in a 300-degree oven.
Variation: Use cookie cutters, a pastry bag, or an indented pizza slicer to shape cheese straws.
Cut into coins, triangles, hearts, or specialty shapes for special parties.

Coat the brisket with dry rub and rub in.
The whole brisket should have a brown red color when done.
Wrap brisket in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Prepare your smoker for a long, 'low and slow' cook.
I cook my brisket at 215F for 16 hours, and always make sure the water pan has ample water.
I use hickory for my smoke
Smoke it!
It's done when the internal temperature is 190-200 degrees.
When smoking the temperature will get into the 160's quickly but don't worry, it will stay there for hours as the fat and connective tissue renders.
This is the magic of low and slow.
Remove from smoker and immediately wrap in aluminum foil and place in a cooler to rest for 2 hours
Remove from cooler, unwrap and slice against the grain.
Enjoy!

1.
Preheat oven to 350 F. 2.
For the topping: Place all-purpose flour, brown sugar, and vegan butter in a medium size mixing bowl.
Use a pastry cutter or your fingers (using a crumbling motion) to blend until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.
Set aside.
3.
For the cake: Place all-purpose flour, salt, brown sugar, and vegan butter in a large mixing bowl.
Again, use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.
4.
Stir baking soda into the boiling water in a medium-sized bowl.
The mixture will fizz, so add the baking soda in a few steps instead of all at once.
This will prevent the mixture from bubbling over the sides of your container!
5.
Stir the baking molasses into the water/baking soda mixture.
6.
Add this liquid mixture to the dry cake ingredients in the large mixing bowl.
Mix with a fork until its pretty smooth.
Set aside.
7.
For the bottom layer: Stir baking soda into boiling water in a medium-sized bowl.
Again, add the baking soda in parts, not all at once.
8.
Stir the table molasses into this water/baking soda mixture.
9.
Pour the wet bottom layer into a greased or non-stick 9-inch by 9-inch square baking pan.
10.
Slowly drizzle the cake layer over the wet bottom layer in the pan.
I pour in circular patterns starting small in the center of the pan and then moving out to the edges of the pan.
Try to evenly cover the wet bottom layer.
11.
Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly on top of the cake layer in the pan.
12.
Bake at 350 F until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (except for some crumb topping), about 40 minutes.
Start checking for doneness at 35 minutes just to be safe.
I started with a Wet Bottom Shoofly Cake recipe from cooks.com, which I veganized and changed to make the texture fluffier and get the cake and crumb topping closer to what youd find in a traditional Shoofly Pie.



Combine apricots, sugar and flour in mixing bowl (amount of sugar will vary depending on sweetness of fruit).
Place in 9-inch glass pie plate or possibly 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish and dot with butter.
Set aside.
Roll out pie crust to fit dish.
Place over top of fruit and trim off overhanging edges.
Cut 4 to 6 slits in pie crust.
Bake at 350 degrees till crust is brown, 30 to 40 min.
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
Comments: The key to the recipe's success, is getting really ripe, flavorful apricots.
You can use fresh fruit, but it's also excellent using frzn apricots.
The secret is, if you're lucky sufficient to have a Blenheim apricot tree, then you'll get real apricot flavor.
Do not fool and fiddle with nice-looking big apricots; they will not have any flavor.



Put your cherries in a small bowl and add warm water to cover.

In a food processor grind praline to fine powder.
Praline powder may be made 2 days ahead and chilled in an airtight container.



* Note: Soft, ripe apricots make jam with the most flavor, and they cook down and thicken faster.
Taste the mix before, during and after cooking to sweeten to your own liking.
This jam will darken in the jar over time.
Wash the apricots.
Cut them in half through the natural indentation and remove the pits.
Slice each half into 2 lengthwise strips.
There should be approximately 4 qts.
In a large nonaluminum bowl, gently combine the apricot slices, sugar, honey and lemon juice.
Allow the mix to stand at room temperature for 3 to 4 hrs, stirring several times to keep the fruit coated and to help the juices dissolve the sugar.
Place the fruit mix in a 6- to 8-qt shallow pan and bring to a boil over high heat.
With a metal spoon or possibly fine mesh skimmer, skim off any foam which collects on the surface and reduce the heat to medium.
Continue cooking and skimming, stirring occasionally, till the mix is thick with a few chunks left, 50 to 60 min, and the whole mass appears slightly glazed.
To test whether jam is ready, remove 2 Tbsp.
to a small saucer and place it in the freezer for 5 min.
Meanwhile turn off the heat under the pan.
When the test amount is cold, it will wrinkle slightly when slowly pushed together with your finger.
If it doesn't, continue cooking for another 5 min and test again.
When ready, the jam will be thick but will still flow from a spoon.
You can also test the jam by scooping some out in a metal spoon and then pouring it back into the pot.
When the jam begins to pour out in a single sheet rather than in several different streams, it's done.
Make sure you have clean jars and rims and fresh lids which have never been used (lids and rims can be purchased separate from jars).
Dip every jar and lid (as well as any other implements which will touch the finished jam) into a large pot of boiling water for at least 3 min.
Afterward, remove them to a baking sheet and keep them in a 250 degree oven till you are ready to use them.
When the jam is cooked, ladle it into the jars, coming within 1/4-inch of the top (a wide-mouthed canning funnel makes this easy).
Wipe the threads of the jar clean and place the lid on top of the jar.
Screw down the rim as tight as it will go.
Place the sealed jars in boiling water to cover for 10 min.
Remove them to a sideboard and let them cold.
You should hear a repeated "plink-plink" as the cooling jars form the vacuum which seals the lid.
When the jars are cold, test each by pushing down in the center of the lid.
There should be no flex in the lid.
If there is, return the sealed jar to the boiling water for another round.
Don't tighten the rims further.
Store jams and jellies in a cold, dark place, such as a pantry.
This recipe yields 9 (8-oz) jars.
Yield: 9 half-pints



Pour the cream into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk.
Tightly cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap, and start the mixer on medium-high speed.
The cream will go through the whipped stage, thicken further, and then change color from off-white to pale yellow; this will take at least 5 to 8 minutes.
When is starts to look pebbly, it's almost done.
After another minute the butter will separate, causing the liquid to splash against the plastic wrap.
At this point stop the mixer.
Set a strainer over a bowl.
Pour the contents of the mixer into the strainer and let the buttermilk drain through.
Strain the buttermilk again, this time through a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl - set aside.
Keeping the butter in the strainer set over the first bowl, knewad it to consolidate the reamaining liquid and fat and expel the rest of the buttermilk.
Knead until the texture is dense and creamy - about 5 minutes.
Strain the excess liquid onto the buttermilk.
Refrigerate the buttermilk.
Mix salt into the butter, if you want.
Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate.

Measure out all of your ingredients (and keep your butter in the fridge) and pull out all of the tools you need (you will need a 2-quart heavy bottomed pot with a lid, a candy thermometer, a small heavy bottomed pot, and a whisk).
Pour the water into your 2-quart pot, and pour the sugar into the center of the pot.
You want to create a little mound of sugar submerged under the water, so make sure to pour the sugar into one spot of the pot!
Cover the pot, and bring to a boil over high heat, which will take about 3 minutes.
Remove lid and insert your candy thermometer.
Keep boiling the sugar until it reaches 300 F, which will take about 15 minutes.
Then reduce the heat to medium.
Place the cream in the small heavy-bottom pot and bring to a simmer over high heat.
(In a perfect world your cream will reach a simmer once the sugar reaches 350 F in the next step, but if it reaches a simmer early, just remove it from the heat.)
Once the sugar reaches 350 F (this will happen about 5 minutes after you reduce the heat to medium in step 4), it will be a dark amber color and begin to smoke.
At this point, immediately turn off heat.
(If you have an electric stove remove it from the burner.)
Very slowly stream in the warm cream.
The sugar will bubble, but as long as you do this step slowly, you will be good to go!
Once all of the cream is added whisk the mixture well.
Add the salt (if you dont want to make salted caramel, just add a pinch of salt here; if you want salted caramel, add the full listed amount) and butter and whisk until it is completely incorporated (the butter will probably bubble a bit too).
Let it cool and then pour over a large scoop of vanilla ice cream or store in an airtight container in the fridge!

Day 2: Make the bread Grease a large mixing bowl with vegetable oil and set aside.
To make the dough, place your bread flour, warm water, yeast, salt and the poolish/starter into a stand mixer bowl with the dough hook attached.
Mix on low for 3-4 minutes.
Increase speed to medium and knead for an additional 3 minutes or until the dough is a smooth consistency.
Pour dough into the greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 45 minutes.
Once rested, turn out the dough onto a floured surface.
Grabbing the right side of your dough, stretch and fold that half of the dough as if you were folding a piece of paper into three sections.
Repeat this with the left side of the dough.
Repeat this tri-fold process from the top half of the dough log and then do the same with the bottom half of the dough log.
Place the dough into a freshly greased bowl.
Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise again for an additional 45 minutes.

Let them rest for about 20 minutes.
Return logs to a floured surface, pressing on each section of dough to release air bubbles.
Flip dough over so the seam side is facing upwards.
Fold the log in half from the top down.
Now seal the dough using the heel of your hand.
Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough until it becomes a log about 14-16 inches long.
Repeat this process with the rest of the loaves.
Set them onto a pan that youve lined with floured parchment paper.
Cover with plastic wrap and let them rise one last time for 45 minutes.
After final rise is complete, cut small slits into the top of each of the loaves with a sharp knife or razor blade.
This will allow the bread to vent while baking.
Transfer 2 baguettes on the piece of parchment paper to the baking stone or doubled baking sheets.

This recipe will make approximately 1 1/2 quarts of ice cream.
Begin by freezing your ice cream maker canister.
It is very important that it is completely frozen.
Otherwise follow your ice cream maker instructions.
If you do not have an ice cream maker, get one, seriously, get one.
Once the ice cream canister is frozen, add the milk and sugar to a mixing bowl.
Mix with a whisk until all of the sugar dissolves.
Add in the vanilla extract and the heavy cream.
Remove the canister from the freezer.
Assemble your ice cream maker, turn it on, and add your ice cream mixture.
Let the mixer spin for at least 30 minutes or according to manufacturers instructions.
You will begin to see the ice cream coming together.
After 30 minutes of churning, add the peanut butter and chocolate chips into a bowl.
Place in the microwave for about 30 seconds, just to slightly soften and melt the chips.
Use a spoon and begin drizzling the mixture into the ice cream, using about half of the mixture.
Let this spin for about five minutes.
Stop the ice cream maker, then remove the paddle from the ice cream maker, and fold in the remaining chocolate chips and peanut butter.
Take a bite, then back away quickly as you will be tempted to eat the whole bowl!
Next, spoon the mixture into an airtight container and place in the freezer until you are ready to serve.
I bought some pint size ice cream containers in the past, just to add a bit more excitement when the kids open the freezer looking for a treat.

oil in water.
Place salt in water.
Add 6 cups flour one at a time and mix as you are adding.
Making sure to remove any lumps.
Should be smooth before adding next cup.
Pour Yeast mixture in other bowl that you set aside into mixture.
Mix until smooth.
Continue to add flour mixing thoroughly until dough is sticky and forms a ball (note you will have to use your hands to mix it after its too tough to mix with a spoon.
It should take only about a maximum of 17 cups of flour.
Take dough out of bowl and place on a flat clean dry surface which was sprinkled with about 1/2 cup of flour.
Knead dough with hands for about 15 minutes or so.
Dough should be soft and feel light to to touch.
TIP: To prevent the dough from sticking to your hands a lot rub vegetable oil on them or take a piece of margarine and rub it into your hands then continue to knead dough.
DO NOT ADD MORE FLOUR!
It will make your bread dough TOO HEAVY!
if you do.
Separate dough in half.
Place each half in a bowl.
Place a light towel over it and let the dough rise for 1 hour or until doubled.
FOR BUNS: Take about the size of a baseball of dough in your hand roll into a ball and place it on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Let rise for another 1/2 hour or until buns are double in size.
For buns to rise tall place them close together almost touching.
Bake at 375F.
FOR LOAVES: Take a large amount of dough and roll into a roll dough should not take up more than half of the loaf pan.
Make sure dough roll is even or you will end up with a lopsided loaf or narrow loaf.
Let rise for 1 to 2 hours.
Or until Dough is nicely formed above the rim of the loaf pan.
Bake at 350F for 45 minutes or until golden brown.
To test to see if done knock on top of the loaf.
If it sounds hollow it is completed baking.
It will be a dark golden brown color when finished.
Take Loaves out of oven and take them IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE PANS upside down.
(If you leave them till cooled in pans what happens is the bottom crust gets soggy from the condensation).
Brush melted butter over top of loaves to prevent from drying out.
Yield: 4 loaves 2 dozen buns.
Depends on size.
TIP: This bread dough is great for anything such as pizza crusts, cinnamon buns, take a bit and roll it out thin and place it in a frying pan with a little oil and fry it and serve with jam or peanut butter.

Brush the biscuits with some cream and sprinkle with sugar.
Place in the oven for 12-15 minutes.
Remove from oven once finished and serve.



Combine all ingredients (except peanut butter) in a saucepan stirring constantly until all ingredients are dissolved.
Let the mixture cool completely then add the peanut butter and stir well.
It will look like a mess, but keep stirring and it will turn out smooth and still have the grain texture...just like Friendlys!



Place in food processor milk, flour, and salt.
Cut up butter into cubes.
Place in food processor.
Give it a few pulses until blended.
Lightly pack in large airtight container.
Store in refrigerator.
In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) sauce mix with 1 cup (225 ml) cool water.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until thickened.

Add peanuts if desired at this point.
Let cool a little (take the kids to wash their hands - that will take just the right amount of time!
).
Press popcorn into balls.
(Kids love this!
).
Eat what sticks on your hands.



Beat the butter until light and fluffy.
Stir in the three cheeses, cayenne pepper, mustard powder, and flour.
Mix well.
If the dough is too crumbly, add milk tablespoon by tablespoon, until the dough holds together.
Pat the dough into a disc and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 300F.
Roll the dough out into a large 1/4-inch thick circle.
Use a scalloped cookie cutter to cut out the shortbreads.
Place on a greased cookie sheet and bake 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown.



In a large bowl, add rice and cover with lots of water.
Stir rice in water with your hands, then pour off most of the water, and agitate 10 to 15 times by quickly moving your hand back and forth, swishing rice against side of bowl.
Rinse the rice several more times, until the water that drains off of the rice is almost clear.
Transfer the rice to a colander and let drain for 1 hour, undisturbed.
Transfer the rice to a rice cooker, add the water, cover, and cook as directed by manufacturer's directions.
While the rice is cooking, bring rice vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan, and then remove from the heat.
Add sugar and salt and stir until dissolved.
Allow to cool to room temperature.
When rice is done, allow cooked rice to remain in rice cooker for 10 minutes.
Transfer rice to a large shallow mixing bowl (traditionally a wooden tub, called a hangiri), so that rice forms a mound in the center of the bowl.
Using a diagonal slicing motion, gently cut into rice with a wooden paddle (called a kijakushi), and pour cooled vinegar mixture over top of rice.
"Cut" rice several times to evenly distribute vinegar mixture, then allow to cool.
Gently turn rice over from time to time with paddle so that rice cools evenly.
You might want to consider using a fan if time is of the essence.
When rice has cooled to body temperature, it is ready to use for sushi rolls.
Rice can be kept at the proper temperature by placing it in an insulated container such as a small ice chest, covered with a damp kitchen towel.



Press tofu to remove excess water: Place tofu on a flat surface.
Cover with a cutting board, and place an iron skillet or a similarly heavy object on top.
Allow it to sit for about 30 minutes.
Crumble tofu into a medium bowl.

If desired, stir in onion, carrot, and seeds.
Refrigerate.



Peel and cut sweet potatoes into chunks.
Steam for about 10-15 minutes until soft and mashable.
In a large bowl, add the steamed sweet potates, butter/oil and salt.
Mash well with a fork.
Add the rye flour, bread flour and yeast to the bowl.
Pour over about 100 ml water and mix with your hands.
If it's still a little dry and crumbly, add more water until the dough is moist.
Squeeze and knead the dough together with your hands until it's not longer floury.
Remove to a floured working surface.
Knead the dough until smooth, about 10-15 minutes.
It will be a little 'grainier' and tough than regular bread dough because of the sweet potatoes.
If using sesame seeds, put them into a large bowl and then add the kneaded dough to the bowl.
Knead the dough in the bowl until the sesame seeds are worked in.
Place dough in a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Place in refrigerator and let slowly rise for 9 hours.
After 9 hours the dough will be about doubled!
Dived into 8 equal pieces.
Form each piece into a round bread roll by folding over the edges to the center and pressing the folds to seal.
The other side should be nice and round & smooth.
Dust each roll with rye flour.
I put some rye flour in a small bowl and then roll the rolls around in it.
Arrange the dusted rolls on a baking sheet and lightly cover with a tea towel.
Let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile preheat the oven to 230C/450F (if possible, prepare to bake with steam too)
Right before putting in the oven, make a cut across the center of each roll.
Put in the oven, and bake 230C/450F with steam for 10 minutes.
Then release the steam, lower temperature to 200C/400F and bake for another 10 minutes [Total baking time = 20 minutes]
Remove from oven and let cool on a rack.
Enjoy!

Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan.
or- I use Parchment paper VERY lightly greased -- and even then, i wipe it off with a napkin so it is just barly covered.
In a LARGE pot (because it tripples in size ladies) combine sugar, corn syrup, evaporated milk, whipping cream, and butter.
Monitor the heat of the mixture with a candy thermometer while stirring.
When the thermometer reaches ABOUT 242-250 degrees.
***If you want the kind of caramel that is really soft and stringy when you bite into it, cook closer to 242.
If you want chewier caramel yet they are still beautifully soft, cook closer to 250*** This usually takes around 40-50 minutes, and cook on a medium heat -- It will not burn this way- it my be necessary to turn it up at about 220 -- It seems to sit at that temp if you dont increase the heat.
But you must stand and stir constantly at that point so it doesnt burn.
Remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla.
Transfer mixture to the prepared pan and let the mixture cool completely.
When cooled cut the Carmel into small squares USING A PLASTIC KNIFE and wrap them in wax paper for storage.
The plastic knife is a God-send -- Slides right through.



Combine all ingredients and stir to combine.
Do not drain the pineapple (the raisins will absorb any extra juice).
Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.



Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with plastic wrap, overlapping as needed to completely cover the bottom and sides and leaving at least a 5-inch overhang.
(If possible, use a pan that does not have sloping sides.)
Drop the ice cream in large dollops into the pan and spread to the edges with a rubber spatula.
Cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and press on the surface of the ice cream with the bottom of a measuring cup until its packed into a smooth, even layer.
Freeze until solid, at least 3 hours.
Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper.
Tape each corner of the paper down and place the baking sheets in the freezer.
When the ice cream is solid, remove the pan and 1 baking sheet from the freezer.
Grasping the plastic wrap, pull the ice cream slab out of the pan and place it on a cutting board.
Remove and discard the plastic wrap.
Slice the slab into 9 even squares.
Using a flat spatula, transfer and evenly space the squares on the baking sheet.
Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours.
Fill a large bowl with 2 inches of cold water, add 3 to 4 ice cubes, and set aside.
Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, reduce the heat to low and maintain a bare simmer.
Place 24 ounces of the chocolate in a large, dry, heatproof bowl.
Set the bowl over the saucepan and stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F. If either happens, start over, as the chocolate is no longer usable.)
Remove the bowl from the saucepan.
Add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate and stir constantly, scraping against the bottom of the bowl, until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. To speed the cooling process, after all of the chocolate has melted you can place the bowl over the reserved cold-water bath.
Return the bowl to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 86 degrees F; immediately remove from heat.
Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 85 degrees F and 87 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range or it will not set up properly.)
Keep the saucepan over low heat and use it to reheat the chocolate as necessary.
To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on parchment or waxed paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set.
If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered.
(If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 86 degrees F.)
Have a fork and flat spatula ready.
Remove the empty baking sheet and the baking sheet with the ice cream squares from the freezer.
Working quickly, use the flat spatula to drop 1 ice cream square into the chocolate.
Using the fork, flip the square, making sure the edges are covered in chocolate.
Lift the square out of the chocolate with the fork and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl to even out the coating.
Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate.
Place the coated square on the empty baking sheet.
Repeat with the remaining squares and chocolate, tilting the bowl as needed to pool the chocolate in one area, and spacing the squares as close together as possible on the baking sheet without touching.
(If the ice cream squares start to melt, return them to the freezer until firm before continuing.)
Freeze the dipped ice cream bars until the chocolate coating has hardened and the ice cream is solid, at least 2 hours.
Wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then foil, and store in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.

Add rice and cream.
Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Cover and cook for 20 minutes, until rice is tender.
Serve hot sprinkled with parsley.



Mix ingredients with hands or a mixer, and knead well "(I like my dough to be slightly sticky).
I have found by experience that it needs a lot of kneading to develop the gluten so as to keep them together well so they don't break when folded or filled.
Let dough sit (covered) for about 30 minutes to rest.
Pull off a handful at a time, roll into a ball, and then flatten thin with a rolling pin on a floured countertop or with a tortilla press (I love my press - it flattens and cooks at the same time :).
Cook on a hot pan or griddle for about 30 seconds on each side - if they are too crispy take them off a little sooner next time.
Keep them covered with a towel on a plate until ready to serve.
Also optional: an egg (will need a little more flour), or 1 tsp baking powder.
I usually end up doubling this recipe because even though it makes a lot, my kids scarf down quesadillas made with these.

Let ferment at room temperature for 1 hour up to 4 hours.Starter will have bubbled up and risen in the bowl.
Flour Mixture:.
Combine the 1 3/4 cups bread flour and the yeast.
Add to the risen sponge in the mixing bowl.Do not add salt at this time.
With the dough hook installed mix on low speed (# 2 on a Kitchenaid) for about one minute until you have a rough dough.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Sprinkle on the salt at this stage and knead with dough hook (#4 speed) for about 7 minutes.
Instant read thermometer plunged into the center should read 78 to 80 degrees.
The dough should be very elastic, smooth and slightly sticky;If too sticky,add a little flour up to 1/4 cup.
You can knead in any extra flour by hand after you remove the dough from the bowl.
Let the dough rise in an oiled covered bowl until double at room temperature.
Press the dough down, fold it over and let rise again for another l hour.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
The dough may be formed into a ball or,placed in an 8 X 4 greased bread pan or rolled out to an oblong loaf.
Free form loaves should be placed on a cookie sheet that has been sprinkled with flour or cornmeal.
Cover the shaped dough and allow it to double.
The freeform oblong loaf should be 8" by 3"inches high.
In the loaf pan the center should be 1" higher then the sides of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 475 1 hour before baking.
Adjust oven shelf to lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it before preheating the oven.
At this stage I like to mist the loaf with water and roll it in sesame seeds, poppy seeds or other whole grains.
Slash freeform bread diagonally with a sharp knife or razor blade making 1/2" deep slices.
If using a loaf pan, make 1 slash down the center or leave unslashed.
Bake for 10 minutes at 475 then turn oven down to 425 and continue to bake for 20 to 30 minutes more or until Instant Read Thermometer reads about 200 degrees.
Cover halfway through baking if loaf becomes too brown.
Let bread cool thoroughly before slicing.

Dough should form ball after a minute or two in the mixer with the dough hook- if you are mixing by hand do so until it forms a ball.
Dough should not feel sticky to the touch.
Let it rise in a greased bowl for 1 hour- it should double in size.
Form it into 1 loaf and put it in a buttered loaf pan.
Let it rise again until doubled in size- about 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes or until sides separate a bit from the sides of the pan and it sounds hollow when you knock on the bottom.

Put 200 ml of milk and 100 g of sugar in a large heatproof bowl and microwave for 3 minutes!
Take it out and mix well.
Microwave at 500 W for 14 minutes, or about 9 minutes at 700 W, or 8 minutes at 900 W!
And that's it.
Microwave without covering with plastic.
When it's done it will have reduced in volume by half.
If you put a spoon in when it's fresh out of the microwave it may splatter, so be careful!
Transfer to a sterilized jar while it's still hot.
When it cools down, store in the refrigerator.
If you add a tea bag during the first 3 minutes of cooking in Step 1 to brew out some tea, then take out the tea bag to cook the milk syrup some more, you will have delicious milk tea jam.
To make this in a pan: Combine 400 ml of milk and 200 g of sugar in a pan, and cook over medium heat.
Simmer and reduce while stirring frequently for 20 to 25 minutes.
(Be careful of having it boil over and spill.)
When it becomes creamy and thickened, and takes on a light caramel color, take it off the heat and transfer to sterilized jars while still hot.
When it has cooled down, store in the refrigerator.
When it cools down it becomes even thicker and creamier, and becomes delicious milk jam.
Add to coffee...for sweet and delicious milk coffee.
I topped toast with strawberries and other fruit, and spooned plenty of milk jam on top.
An easy yet delicious dessert.



Making mead requires essentially the same basic kit necessary to brew beer at home: primary and secondary plastic-bucket fermenters with air locks and spigots, transfer hosing, a bottle-filler tube, heavy bottles, bottle caps, bottle capper, and a bottle brush and washer.
You should be able to find these items for approximately $70 total (excluding the bottles) through a home-brewing supplier, such as The Home Brewery.
Bottles cost from $6 to $20 per dozen, depending on style.
You might instead buy a couple of cases of beer in returnable bottles, drink the beer, and after sanitizing them!
reuse those bottles, for the cost of the deposit.
All your equipment must be sanitized or sterilized before use.
Ordinary unscented household bleach does the job fine.
Put all the equipment (including the lid and stirring spoons) into the fermentation bucket, fill with water, and add 2 teaspoons of unscented bleach.
Let it sit for 30 minutes.
Drain the water through the spigot, rinse everything in hot water, and allow to air-dry.
Bring the 4 1/2 gallons of water to a boil.
Well water, by the way, should be avoided because of potentially high levels of strong tasting minerals like iron.
Boiling should remove harsh chlorine from municipal tap water.
If you don't own a pot large enough to hold five gallons of water, boil as much as possible.
You will add the remaining water to the fermenter later.
Once the water reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and stir in all of the honey.
Do not boil the honey, as it reduces the aromatic quality of the finished mead.
While the honey dissolves in the water, put a cup of lukewarm (90 to 100F) water into a clean bowl.
Sprinkle in the yeast and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
When the honey has been fully dissolved in the water and the pot is cool to the touch (not over 80F), pour the honey-water into the fermentation bucket and stir in the yeast mixture.
Note: Cooling the honey-water should take about half an hour.
This process can be accelerated with a so-called sink bath, that is, repeatedly immersing the pot in cold water in a sink or basin.
If you have not already added the full 4 1/2 gallons of water, top it off with the balance in bottled water (or tap water if you're confident of its quality).
Seal the bucket and allow the mixture to ferment for two weeks to one month.
The progress of fermentation can judged by monitoring the carbon-dioxide bubbles escaping from the air lock: When they drop to one bubble every sixty seconds, fermentation has nearly concluded.
Note that is only an issue during this primary fermentation; secondary fermentation has more to do with aging and mellowing and hence is more flexible.
When primary fermentation has subsided, siphon the mead over to your secondary fermentation bucket and seal it.
Allow one to four months aging time.
Do not open the fermenter, as this risks contaminating the mead.
When you decide it has matured enough (and the mead has cleared), you will want to siphon it into sterilized bottles and cap them.
Follow the same procedure as you would for home-brewed beer.
My book Beer for Dummies has a detailed guide in its Chapter Ten, or consult the web site of the American Homebrewers Association.
Keep in mind that this is a recipe for still (i.e., non-carbonated) mead.
Mead typically improves with age, so the longer you can wait to open the bottles, the better.

Preheat oven to 300F.
The oven needs to be on low heat.
Cut the butter into large chunks and put it into an oven proof dish.
Something like a souffle dish will work, but just make sure that the bottom of the pan isn't too wide, or the butter will cook too quickly and you won't have time to get that nice roasted flavor.
Put the butter into the oven for one hour.
At that time, the impurities will have separated from the butter, but it probably won't have darkened in color to show that it has that roasted flavor.
Keep checking the butter every 10 minutes until it darkens several shades.
Remove the butter from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes, and then spoon off the impurities on the top of the butter.
Pour the butter through a fine metal mesh strainer.
Store the clarified butter, covered, in a cool dry place.



Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and bring just to a boil without stirring.

If desired you can use a 1 ounce ice cream style scoop to ensure that the peanut butter balls are relatively the same size.
Place the balls on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Once filled, put the baking sheet in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.
While the peanut butter balls are in the freezer, fill a small pot with 1 of water.
Turn the heat on low and bring the water to a slow simmer.
Place the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl that is slightly larger than the pot you are going to use.
Set the bowl over the pot (make sure the bottom of the bowl doesnt touch the water) and allow the chocolate to slowly melt, stirring until smooth.
Do not increase the heat.
Once the chocolate is melted, remove the bowl and pot from the heat.
Drop one peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate and use a spoon or fork to turn it and completely cover the peanut butter ball in chocolate.
Shake off any excess chocolate and place the peanut butter ball back on the parchment paper.
Continue until all of the peanut butter balls are covered.
If your chocolate starts to become too cool and thick, place the bowl back over the pot on low heat to re-melt.
Refrigerate the balls to harden.
Then store them in a cool, dry place or wrap well and freeze.



I do not know whether you have a bread machine, but here is a buckwheat bread recipe from "Bread Machine Magic" by Rehberg and Conway.
In the past I have replaced the butter which was in the original recipe with applesauce.
This substitution works fine.
Place all ingredients in the bread pan.
Select Light Crust setting, and press Start.
After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cold 1 hour before slicing.



Mix together the flours, caraway, vital wheat gluten in a large mixing bowl.
Because rye takes a longer knead, I decided to use my Kitchenaid mixer rather than the dough setting on my bread machine.
In a glass measuring cup, mix together honey and buttermilk.
Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it hang out for about 15 minutes.
It should get nice and bubbly and frothy.
Pour the milk and yeast mixture into the flour, add the water slowly while it mixes.
Finally add the oil and the salt.
If it is too wet, add a little more flour, if it is too dry add a little more water.
Go slow and test.
This dough is a little more sticky than wheat only.
Cover with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
If you are doing this by hand, warm up so you don't pull a muscle and turn the dough out onto an oil.
Knead for 8-10 minutes until it is nice and smooth.
It definitely takes on a sheen when it's at the right point.
It does not stretch as much as wheat only dough, so don't worry too much.
If you're using magic aka the Kitchenaid Mixer, use the dough hook and knead it for 5 minutes, being sure to push the dough back down as it tries to crawl out.
When it is smooth and shiny, transfer to a large oiled bowl and cover with a towel.
Let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Note: It will rise right out of the mixing bowl, so when I say large bowl, I mean large.
After an hour, punch it down and split into two or three depending on the size you want the loaves to be.
When working with one, keep the rest covered.
Form into a round or into a loaf (if using a pan).
It was here I folded in the caraway in two of the loaves.
Cut a slash into the bread so it does not tear while rising.
Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled, about half an hour or so.
Bake at 350 for 35-45 minutes.
Remove from oven and brush with melted butter for a softer crust.
Note: This bread does NOT brown like wheat only.
It also will not rise in the oven (called an oven rise) so don't think you did something wrong if this is your first fresh milled bread.
I happen to like smaller pieces of bread so I made three loaves, but if you like the more "normal" sized slices, do only two.
Remove from the bread pan after a few minutes so it doesn't get soggy, then let cool on a clean towel.



Melt ingredients on stove top over med.
heat, stirring until mixture is melted and smooth.
Place in fondue pot and watch closely so that it doesn't boil or scorch.

Wash and peel the apples.
Cut each into thin slices, removing the seeds and the hard middle core.
Pour apples in a non-stick pot.
Add enough water to cover the apples, and bring to boil.
Cook over high heat for about 10 minutes.
Add sugar and cook for another 10 minutes.
Add rose-water and lime juice and cook for 2-3 minutes.
The mix should be quite thick when cooking is over.



Clean, Peel and Dice some of the apples (2-3) and add to a 2 quart saucepan.
Add orange juice, lemon juice and cinnamon.
Allow to "stew" on medium heat for 5 minutes.
This will make the apples soft and sweeten naturally in their juices.
Clean, peel and slice the rest of the apples and put the lid on with the heat on low for an additional 5 minutes.
Turn off the heat and mix the corn starch and water in a separate cup.
Add to apples and stir.
This will prevent the apple mix from being too thin and gloopy during the cutting process.
Add to the bottom crust of your favourate pie crust (be sure to perforate it with a fork first!
), add filling and the top layer of dough.
Since the filling is still hot, the cooking time will be cut down; bake at 450 degrees for 25-30 minutes.
This pie is easily prepared and frozen to be cooked later.



In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add pearl onions and peas,.

Serve piping hot!



Combine all ingredients in a baking dish.
I typically use a casserole dish of sufficient size to hold all the ingredients.
Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 350.
NOTE: My family generally puts shredded cheese on top of the potatoes before baking so that there is a nice layer of melted cheese on top of the potatoes.
NOTE: Serving size/amount is a guess.
I know that a halved recipe more than sufficiently feeds 4 people with quite a few leftovers.

Rinse the red currants, and remove any dirt.
You can use as they are, no matter the size and stem or no stem.
Clean the red currants thoroughly, and put them in a jar that was sterilized with boiling water.
Add the red currants, sugar and vinegar in that order.
It looks pretty when you watch them dissolve.
After 1 hour or so, the sugar will settle at the bottom of the jar.
The sugar dissolves quicker if you lay the jar on its side and roll around, or stir with cooking chopsticks.
After the sugar has dissolved, let it sit for 2-3 days to bring out the flavors.
Dilute it to taste, and enjoy!
My oldest daughter likes to dilute it with milk since it turns out like a yogurt drink.This milk was pasteurized at a low temperature and it's light, so it's perfect for this sour drink!
Children loves diluting it with soda water.
The plump texture of the red currants gives this drink a unique accent.
I put the ingredients in a jar during the day, and stirred with cooking chopsticks in the evening.
You can drink it straight away, but it will be tastier if you let it sit for a while to bring out the full flavor.
The translucent red color of red currants is so beautiful.
Red currant jam is also delicious!
They are great for a salad, too.

Danger!
This is the dry-burn technique.
I don't add water to the sugar before putting it on the heat, as some chefs do.
Caramelizing sugar dry means it goes faster, but you have to watch it more closely and be ready with your cream.
Here is an overview of what you are going to do:.
Stand over the pan of sugar with a heatproof spatula ready, but do not touch the sugar until there is a full layer of melted and browning liquid sugar on the bottom with a smaller layer of unmelted white sugar on the top.
When the edges of the melted sugar begin to darken, use the spatula to bring them into the center to help melt the unmelted sugar.
Continue stirring and pushing the sugar around until it is all melted and evenly amber in color--like an old penny.
When little bubbles begin to explode with dark smoke, give the sugar another moment and then remove from the heat.
Immediately but slowly pour about 1/4 cup of the cream and corn syrup mixture into the burning-hot sugar.
Be careful!
It will pop and spit!
Stir until it is incorporated, then add a bit more cream and stir, then continue until it is all inches.
Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry.
Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.
Mix the cream with the corn syrup in a measuring cup with a spout.
Fill a large bowl with ice and water.
Heat the sugar in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat until it is melted and golden amber in color (see note above).
Remove from the heat and, stirring constantly, slowly add a bit of the cream and corn syrup mixture to the caramel: It will fizzle, pop, and spurt.
Stir until well combined, then add a little more and stir.
Keep adding the cream a little at a time until all of it is incorporated.
Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the milk.
Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 4 minutes.
Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry.
Bring back to a boil over medium-high and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.
Remove from the heat.
If any caramel flecks remain, pour the mixture through a sieve.
Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth.
Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath.
Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes.
Pour into frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy.
Pack the ice cream into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid.
Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.



Combine all ingredients.
Mixture will be soft.
Cut into strips.
Bake at 300 degrees F until lightly browned (10 minutes?
).

It will continue to thicken a little once it simmers.
You can add cut up chicken or shrimp to the sauce before pouring over the drained noodles.
Keep in mind, this makes a lot so you may want to reserve some before adding extras as it freezes nicely.
Ive also used this sauce in making homemade chicken spinach alfredo pizzas.

Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a large wooden bowl.
Stir together.
Add spoonfuls of lard or shortening (use 1/2 cup PLUS 2 tablespoons), then use a pastry cutter to combine the ingredients.
Cut mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Slowly pour in hot water, stirring to bring mixture together.
Lightly knead dough 30 to 40 times, or until it becomes a cohesive ball of dough and is less sticky.
Cover with a tea towel and allow dough to rest for at least an hour.
Roll into ping pong size balls, place on a tray, cover with a tea towel, and allow to rest for another 20 to 30 minutes.
When youre ready to make the tortillas, head a dark or cast iron griddle to medium/medium-high heat.
One by one, roll out balls of dough until very, very thin.
Throw tortillas (one by one) onto the griddle.
Cook on each side for 20 to 30 seconds, removing while tortillas are still soft but slightly brown in spots.
Remove and stack tortillas, and cover with a towel to keep warm.
Serve immediately or allow to cool before storing tortillas in a container.
To warm, nuke tortillas in the microwave, or wrap in foil and warm in the oven.
Helpful tips:
* Make sure the water you pour in is very warm.
* Allow the dough to rest, both after kneading and after forming into balls.
* Roll out very thin.
* Get the heat right on your stove: Too hot, and the tortilla will burn in spots.
Not hot enough, and the tortilla will begin to crisp before you can get it to brown.
I get my stove between medium and medium high heat; that seems to do the trick.
* Use a dark griddle or cast iron skillet to brown the tortillas.
* Cook just long enough to lightly brown the tortilla in spots; dont cook too long or tortillas will crisp.
You want them to be soft and pliable when you serve them.
* Finally: Have fun!
And enjoy them.
Theyre absolutely scrumptious.

(If not, proceed, but expect cooking time to be somewhat longer.)
Place in a pot, add water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Partially cover, adjust the heat so the mixture simmers steadily, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are nearly tender and most of the water has evaporated, at least an hour and probably more.
(Add water as necessary to keep the beans covered, but bear in mind that eventually you will want no water at all, so dont drown them.)
Add the sugar, mirin, and soy sauce and raise the heat a bit.
Continue to cook, stirring frequently now, until the beans are glazed and still firm, not quite as tender as youre used to; leave them quite moist (the soy sauce will burn if the mixture dries out).

Mix flour and salt in mixing bowl.
Cut shortening into the flour with a pastry cutter, until mixture resembles the texture of tiny split peas.
Do not use your hands to try and mix it; the heat from your hands will melt the shortening, causing the pastry to be "heavy," not light and fluffy.
Once the mixture is the right texture,, add the ice water and combine with a fork.
It may appear to need more water, it does not.
Quickly gather the dough into a ball and flatten into a 4-inch-wide disk.

OLD SCHOOL METHOD: Mix the yeast and water together in a large mixing bowl with a fork until totally dissolved.
Blend in 1 cup of flour, and all the cornmeal, salt, and oil.
Mix well with a large spoon.
Continue stirring in the rest of the flour in 1/2-cup increments until the dough stops sticking to the sides of the bowl.
Put some flour on your hands and knead the dough until it is no longer sticky, about 5-10 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm, dry, draft-free area for 45-60 minutes to rise until doubled.
Punch it down and knead briefly.
Go to Step #8.
Didn't want to do all that just to have another rise later?
Check out the bread machine instructions!
BREAD MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS: Put all the ingredients into your bread machine according to your manfacturer's directions and do a 1.5-lb or 2-lb dough cycle, kick back and let it do its work.
Press the dough into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pan.
Let it rise for another 20 minutes before pre-baking.
After the rise in the pan is finished, bake at 450F for 10 minutes.
Then add the sauce, cheese, toppings, etc, and whatever else you like and bake at 400F according to how much you put on (ie, meat toppings require longer.)
I like cheese and veggie toppings which only take about 15-20 minutes, then turn on the broiler for 5 minutes to get a nice crispy edge and cheesy crunch.
Don't have a deep-dish pan?
Can probably split this up among casserole dishes and large pie pans.

Then rinse out and dry your bowl and make the streusel.
Add all of the streusel ingredients to the bowl and stir until everything is evenly coated.
Sprinkle the mixture over the cake and press it lightly into the batter using your hand.
Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back lightly under your finger instead of sinking in.
Remove it from the oven and set pan on a rack.
Let it cool slightly and serve warm.
Store leftover cake in a refrigerated, sealed container.

Combine the yeast with the remainder of the ingredients.
Mix and knead everything togetherby hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycletill you've made a soft, smooth dough.
If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom.
Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.
Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it's very puffy.
This will take about an hour using instant yeast.
Shape it into a rough circle.
In either case, don't pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape.
Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.
Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice.

The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch.
Place the dough in the prepared pan(s).
Press it over the bottom of the pan, stretching it towards the edges.
You'll probably get about two-thirds of the way there before the dough starts shrinking back; walk away for 15 minutes.
Cover the dough while you're away, so it doesn't dry out.
Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes.
Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450F.
Bake the pizza on the lower oven rack till it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top.
This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza.
To serve pizza immediately: Remove it from the oven, and arrange your toppings of choice on top.
Return to the oven, and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted.
Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough.
To serve pizza up to 2 days later: Remove the untopped, partially baked crust from the oven, cool completely on a rack, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature.
When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above.
Your goal is a pizza whose crust is browned, and whose toppings are hot/melted.

Make puree and strain Place fruit (and water, when using) in a food processor, and process until very smooth.
Pass through a fine sieve into a deep bowl or a large glass measuring cup, pressing on solids with a flexible spatula to extract as much liquid as possible.
Dont press too hard, or some of the seeds (if there are any) may be forced through the strainer into the liquid.
Discard any solids that remain in the strainer.
Sweeten puree and chill Transfer strained puree (or, for citrus sorbets, strained juice) to a deep bowl or plastic storage container.
Add simple syrup (start with 1 cup syrup, then add more as needed) and stir until it is well combined.
(To determine whether you need more syrup, gently drop a just-cleaned and dried egg into puree and push to submerge completely; when the sugar content is right, a piece of egg about the size of a quarter should be exposed.
If the egg doesnt float to the top, add more syrup; if too much egg is exposed, add more fruit puree.)
Cover bowl or container, and refrigerate until completely chilled before freezing, at least 1 hour (or overnight).

This time, I used confectionery chocolate, but you can use 5 pieces of cubed chocolate like Alphabet Chocolate in Japan or chocolate chips (net about 25 g).
Put the chocolate and 1 tablespoon of milk in a heatproof dish and heat at 600 W for 40 seconds.
Once the chocolate has melted, mix until it becomes smooth.
Once mixed, add the remaining milk and pancake mix.
Mix some more.
Transfer to dishes and place in a 1200 W toaster oven, directly on the rack without a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes (no need to preheat).
If you are using a baking sheet, bake at 900 W for about 10 minutes.
This way turns out prettier.
Note: If baking in an oven, bake at 180C for 10 minutes.
The batter is done quickly, so preheat the oven while you melt the chocolate.
Baking it in an oven definitely gives the prettiest results!
I added a marshmallow on top.
This is also delicious.
By the way, you can mix up the batter in a mug, then heat in the microwave at 600 W for 1:40-1:50 minutes.
Microwaved steamed cake!

1) Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature and very soft.
This will help keep the lumps away.
Smush around until slightly smooth.
2) Add cranberries; stir.
Slowly add in the pomegranate juice.
This will make the spread a little thin.
3) Next add the pineapple and pecans, if desired.
Mix wellthe spread will be a pinkish color from the juice.
4 ) Now the dip needs to chill for at least an hour.
I say overnight is best, so all those flavors get real chummy with one another.
This will also help the spread set up and become much thicker.
5) Once chilled, you can shape it into a ball, roll in more pecans and serve as a dessert cheeseball, or set it out in a pretty dish.
This recipe makes a great bagel spread, or you can eat it with apple slices, vanilla wafers, snickerdoodles, ginger snapsmaybe even some Ritz crackers to balance some sweet and salty?

1.
Heat the milk and cream over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches 185 degrees Fahrenheit.
Do not let the milk boil.
(Note: I saw little bubbles form on the surface at about 175 degrees, at which point I turned down the heat to medium, just to ensure the temperature didnt rush past 185 degrees or start to boil while I wasnt looking.)
(Another note: The surface of the milk will pucker while it heats.
Do not be afraid.
This is normal.
Feel free to skim it off if it freaks you out, but only do this right before the milk hits 185 degrees, because the skin will appear again very quickly.)

5.
Set the colander into the bowl.
Line the colander with several layers of cheesecloth.
6.
After the 2 hours has elapsed, gently scoop the curds into the center of the strainer.
Once youve gotten most of the curds out of the stockpot, pour the remaining liquid and curds into the colander.
Fun fact to know and tell the white liquid is called whey.
7.
Gather the cheesecloth at the top, and if youd like, fasten together with a rubber band/piece of twine/your kids hair ribbon.
Gently squeeze the curds to encourage draining of the whey.
Let the curds continue to drain for 30 minutes, gently squeezing a couple of times during the 30 minutes.
8.
Unwrap the curds and put cheese into an airtight container.
(Note: this recipe made about 3 cups of ricotta for me.)

Saffron Syrup(Sharbat-e Zaferan) Add 1/2 teaspoon ground saffron threads diluted in 2 tablespoons hot water to the rose water.Barberry syrup(Sharbat-e zereshk) Add barberry juice to the rose water syrup above and cook for 5 minutes.
Barberry juice can be made from dried barberries by picking over and thoroughly washing 2 cups of barberries.
Combine with 4 cups of water and boil for 15 minutes over high heat.
Allow to cool and pass through 2 layers of cheesecloth into a bowl.Almond syrup(Sharbat-e badam) Replace rose water with almond milk.
To make almond milk puree 2 cups blanched almonds with 3 cups of boiling water in a food processor for 5 minutes, until creamy.
Strain the mixture through 2 layers of cheesecloth into a bowl.
Reserve the almond milk and discard the solids.Persian musk rose syrup(Sharbat-e nastaran) Replace rose water with musk rose water.Basil-seed syrup(Sharbat-e tokhm-e Sharbaty) Soak 1 cup of basil seeds in 2 cups of water for a few hours, then add soaking seeds to the syrup in Step 2.
An excellent syrup, this sharbat is especially associated with the mother of a newborn baby.Mint leaf syrup(Sharbat-e nana) Replace rose water with mint water.Orange blossom syrup(Sharbat-e gol-e bahar narenj) Replace rose water with orange blossom water.Licorice syrup(Sharbat-e lasmo) Replace rose water with licorice water.Palm syrup(Sharbat-e taruneh) Replace rose water with palm water.Willow syrup(Sharbat-e bidmeshk) Replace rose water with willow water.
NOTE:Rose water(suitable for cooking) and most of the distillates (called araqs in Persian) listed here are available in Persian stores (produced by Sadaf or Qortas).
Batmanglij recommends buying saffron in thread form rather than powder, which is often adulterated with turmeric.
Before they can be used in a recipe, the threads must be ground with a cube of sugar, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and then diluted in hot water.
"The saffron water can then be stored and used as needed," says Batmanglij.
"Never use the unground threads."
Dried barberries, which add a sour flavor to many Persian dishes, are available online at www.sadaf.com.
"Always buy red barberries," cautions Batmanglij.
"Black barberries are old."
Try experimenting with different distillates in this drink.
Musk rose water, made from white Mediterranean roses, gives the sharbat a different flavor than regular rose water, which is made from Persian Damask roses.
Willow water is flowery, while palm water has an earthy flavor.

For the chicken, we apply it under the skin on top and bottom and in the cavity.
Get intimate with the meat and don't be afraid to get dirty.
4.
Place in plastic bags and remove as much air as you can and leave in the fridge overnight.
5.
Heat your smoker to 200-225 and smoke for 3.5 hours, adding wood chunks as needed.
I soak them first but I don't think it makes much difference.
6.
Brush on your favorite sauce (or not) and wrap in foil and smoke for another 1.5 hours.
(Try a spicy raspberry sauce for a nice change.
).



Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 400F (200C).

(I dont recommend using silicone baking mats for this recipe as the croquants wont be as crisp.)
In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and flour, then stir in the egg whites and salt until smooth.
Stir in the almonds or hazelnuts.
Drop level teaspoons of batter at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake, rotating the baking sheets midway during baking, until the cookies are toasty brown in color, 10 to 12 minutes.
Let cool completely on the baking sheets.
The batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.
Let it come to room temperature before spooning and baking.
Store the baked croquants in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

Turn off the heat once you hear the popping slow down a bit, about 1-2 minutes.
Let the pot rest for about one minute before removing the lid.
Transfer the popcorn into a large bowl and sprinkle the popcorn salt over the first few ladlefuls of popcorn.
Continue to add the popcorn to the bowl and season the top with a little more popcorn salt before serving.
Side note: it is very important that you use popcorn salt.
Popcorn salt is just salt that is very fine, but because it is so fine, it sticks to the popcorn.
Regular salt wont stick to the kernel and youll have bland popcorn.
Another good thing to know is this popcorn keeps well in a ziplock bag for about a week.

Homemade Yoghurt.
Makes two quarts/liters.
A thermometer for liquids.
A batch jar, or dishwasher-safe plastic container, with lid.
Insulation.
2 U.S. quarts/2 liters milk, any kind including powdered (3 cups powder for 2 quarts).
(2 tsps gelatin optional).
4 Tbsps yoghurt for the starter.

INCUBATE.
The yoghurt bacteria, like yeast, is a live organism, to be kept warm and out of drafts.
I've used a small foam cooler, an insulated drinks cooler, a thick old small quilt successfully.
Let stand, wrapped, until it curdles, usually about 3 - 5 hours.
REFRIGERATE.
Just put it in (no stirring needed) for about 8 hours before serving.
Keeps about 3 - 4 weeks.
COMMENTS.
The creamy consistency and taste is amazing when you're used to store-bought.
Save 4 Tbsps for the next starter batch.
Add whatever you fancy to eat--fruit, honey, crumbles, cereals.
My family used to go through a whole batch in a couple of days.
I substitute it in many recipes that call for mayonnaise, sour cream, creme fraiche, salad dressing (adding a squeeze of lemon and herbs).
A friend commented she now has yoghurt coming out the wazoo but she's trying it for frozen yoghurt to take to work.
I've never tried microwaving to scald the milk but then, back when, I didn't have a microwave either.
Do NOT use Imperial Measure!

To begin , cut the chicken brestsa into even 3 inch pats and put in a big bowl.
Mix the marinade ingredients together untill a liquidy mass.
Stir in the marinade evenly and let the chicken sit overnight in the fridge, so that the marinade seeps into the meat.
Personally i like using an old conventional cast iron pot to slow cook this in but , a slow cooker or even a glass version of this would work fine too.
Oil up the bottom and the sides of the pot you are going to cook in, because at first the chicken is very prone to sticking and burning.
Put the chicken into the pot and add half the Jack Daniel's Bbq sauce bottle , and stir.
I personally like using the Honey Smokehouse kind.
On high , sear the chicken in the pot for about 15-20 minutes.
After preheat oven to 360F.
Pour in the rest of the Jack Daniel's Bbq sauce and leave in oven for an hour or so.
Check on the chicken every 20 minutes stiring it.
After the hour has elapsed , you can start breaking the chicken up using a wooden spoon.
Not all at the same time though.
Break some let it cook then break some more , untill the chicken is fully in strands.
After the chicken is fully in strands and ready let it sit in the oven for another 10 minutes, and its done!
Enjoy the great taste and the easy prep and cooking.

It's for a bread machine, but you could make it by hand in the conventional way, as well.
Place ingredients in your bread maker in order given (start at bottom for a Welbilt/Dak bread machine), set crust to light and bake on white bread setting.
To make it by hand, make basic white bread adding the extra ingredients.



Combine all the ingredients and knead.
Roll it up once it becomes somewhat smooth.
If you're using a bread maker, let it knead for about 10 minutes,and then take it out and roll it up.
No rising.
Leave it to rest for 20 minutes.
Spray water and cover with a wet paper towel.
Roll it out into the shape of your choice and place it on top of parchment paper.
Poke holes with a fork.

This pizza is topped with dried curry sauce and cheese Very easy to make using leftovers, but still good.
Pizza with tomatoes, cheese, and mayonnaise.
Pizzas are fun to make, since you can do so with a variety of toppings.
Here is an example of using this dough to make it into a naan to go with curry.



Place very warm water, yeast and sugar in food processor and pulse once or twice to mix.
While most recipes will tell you to use lukewarm water when making yeast dough, I find that by the time you take hot water, put it into a measuring cup and then into a food processor, it has cooled significantly.
I always use water that is almost too hot to the touch, and have always had great luck with this dough.
Let sit while you measure out the dry ingredients.
After 2-3 minutes you will see small bubbles forming in the liquid in the food processor, which indicates that your yeast is working.
Dump in the dry ingredients and turn on the food processor.
The machine will go all the work, including the kneading.
After about a minute the dough should form into a ball going around in your food processor.
Open the machine and take a look.
If you think the dough is too wet, you can add a bit a flour, but know that too wet is better than too dry, and the dough will loose some of its stickiness as it rises.
Place about a tablespoon of olive oil in a large bowl.
Take the dough out of the food processor (putting a little olive oil on your hands will keep it from sticking) and form it into a ball.
Place in the bowl and turn to lightly coat with the olive oil.
Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm, draft free place for about an hour or until doubled in size, before rolling out and baking.
For a crust with a perfect pizzeria taste and texture, I recommend baking on a pizza stone in a very hot oven (500 - 550F for about 10 -12 minutes.



Steam or boil green beans until just underdone to your liking (I make mine crisp-tender).

Sprinkle with sugar and stir to coat, about 1 minute.
Lower heat and add mustard and worcestershire sauce, stirring well, and saute for another 2 minutes or so.

Cook broccoli according to desired method (boil, steam, or stir-fry in a small amount of vegetable oil).
Do not overcook.
Combine remaining ingredients in a small bowl.
Pour over broccoli.
Cook and stir until broccoli is coated and sauce becomes thick (won't take long).

To measure, push the roughly chopped arugula into your measuring cup -- not too hard, but don't measure loosely.
Put this in your processor.
Add the rest of the ingredients, and whizz.
I prefer a pesto which is not too smooth, but slightly "granular" still.
NOTES: If you're using ready-washed arugula and parsley which are dry, you might want to add a tiny bit more oil.
Mine usually has water on the leaves, which adds to the liquid available.
You can toast the walnuts lightly.
I prefer walnuts because they contain more oil than other nuts.
The arugula should definitely be young -- the moment they start going to seed the leaves become very bitter.
The pesto should stand, covered, in the fridge for a few hours or more, as the flavours then meld better.
Delicious forked into hot al dente spaghetti, with extra, fresh parmesan shavings on top.
Can be dropped into a mixed greens salad by teaspoonsful.
I eat this on hot toast as well.

Place all ingredients in a covered jar and allow to sit for a couple of days so that the seeds soften.
Dont get too persnickety about the time frame.
I can tell you with absolute certainty that if your week gets a little out of control busy with too many people needing too many things, it will be OK if you leave the soaking seeds sitting on your counter for a full week.
Over the course of a couple of days, the seeds will absorb almost all of that liquid.
If the liquid is completely absorbed and your seeds look a little dry, add a bit more apple cider vinegar.
Mine didnt need any more liquid, but yours might.
After a couple of days (or a week) pour the contents of the jar into your blender and process until the mustard is the desired consistency.
Less if you like it grainy, more if you prefer it creamy.
Put the finished mustard right back into the jar the seeds were inches Not even a jar to wash!
You can keep simple and just added a bit of thyme for seasoning or you can go crazy with different flavors.
If you like traditional yellow mustard, add a bit of turmeric.
You can use beer or white wine in place of the apple cider vinegar for a different flavor, too.
The mustard mellows a bit as it sits, but its still quite bold.

In Ruth's own words:.
I use 50 grams of vanilla beans to 1 liter of vodka (45% alc/vol) to make mine.
Check the percentage of alc/vol printed on the bottle; there are many different strengths offered.
(By law, commercially sold pure vanilla extract must contain a minimum of 35% alcohol by volume).
Cut the vanilla beans into small pieces and drop into a bottle of vodka (pour a little vodka out first, as the vanilla beans will cause some displacement).
That's it!
Now you just have to wait for it to steep.
I'll tell you why I cut up the beans, rather than leaving them whole.
The power of the infusion comes from keeping the essential matter (in this case vanilla, which provides the 'essence') submerged in the liquid (in this case, vodka).
Vanilla beans are long and thin, and will stand up vertically in the bottle.
If you are making a small amount (less than a full bottle) the vodka level may not cover all the beans.
Even when using a full bottle of vodka, little by little this will be poured off as you use the extract, meaning the upper part of the (uncut) beans will quickly become exposed to the air.
The longer the beans steep totally submerged the stronger the flavor of the extract.
That is why I wrote that I pour off only a small amount at a time (enough to fill a 100 ml bottle- less than 4 ounces) and keep this on my spice shelf for regular use.
The remainder I leave in the vodka bottle to further infuse with flavor.
By cutting up the vanilla beans, the pieces will sink to the bottom of the bottle so even as I pour off the extract and the vodka level drops, the remainder continues to infuse as all of the vanilla bean pieces are submerged, and the extract continues to develop flavor.
Aside from this, cutting open the seed pods gives greater access (maximum contact) to the flavor cells.
Remember, you will need to filter the extract if the pods were cut--the seeds are very tiny (like ground poppy) so I recommend straining through something very fine, like coffee filter paper.
Okay, so now it has to steep for a couple of months.
It will get darker and darker over time; strain before using.
I strain and transfer a small amount into a small bottle for everyday use (allowing the original batch in the vodka bottle to further intensify in flavor).
Here's the fun part: the same vanilla beans may be reused to make more essence!
When the liter is all used up, I refill the vodka 50% of the original (using 500 cc or 1/2 liter of vodka) for the second infusion.
When that is used up I may go for a 3rd infusion, using 50% of the previous (this time 250 cc or 1/4 liter of vodka)-- as long as the color comes through the flavor will too.
You really cannot imagine how much flavor these beans contain!
I remember when I first read about doing a 2nd or 3rd infusion (using the same beans) I was skeptical, thinking that this was stretching things too far-- but when I tried it, I found that it really works!
As long as you see the color come through, the flavor will also be there.
As I explained, I cut the vodka in half for each successive infusion, compensating for depleted flavor by raising the concentration factor.
I have been making all my own vanilla extract for years using this method with excellent results.
Commercial vanilla extract is made from the lowest quality vanilla beans: rejects and broken pieces that cannot be sold in open market.
When making the extract yourself, however, you have control over the quality of the vanilla beans used.

* Curing salts are used in food preservation to prevent or slow spoilage by bacteria or fungus.
They usually contain sodium nitrite which serves to inhibit the growth of bacteria, specifically Clostridium botulinum in an effort to prevent botulism, and helps preserve the color of cured meat.
Many also contain red dye that makes them pink to prevent them from being confused with common table salt.
Curing salts are not to be confused with Himalayan pink salt, which is pure salt with trace elements that give it a pink color.
The human digestive system manufactures nitrites naturally, which is thought to help prevent botulism, which would thrive in the anaerobic conditions and temperature range of the digestive system.
However, it is important to note that large amounts of sodium nitrite can be hazardous to your health or even be lethal.
The FDA deems sodium nitrite as safe used in the proper proportion.



The measurement of the banana peppers is 16 ounces of them by volume AFTER they are drained, so you'll probably need a couple of regular-sized jars if you plan to make the full recipe.
Pour the drained hot pepper slices into a mixing bowl and remove any tops with stems or hard pieces.
Don't worry about a few seeds if some are present.
In a food processor, dump in the drained pepper slices and turn them into "mush".
In a mixing bowl, blend the pepper mush with the mustard.
Store under refrigeration in sanitized jars.
NOTE: My hunting pals and I have found that this recipe tastes best with one of the following three (fairly tart) brands of mustard: Heinz (my favorite); French's, or; Plochmans.
ALSO, I use pepper slices instead of whole peppers because there are very few seeds in the canned sliced peppers.



Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and dry yeast in a bowl and lightly mix.
If using fresh yeast, soak in lukewarm water.
Add the lukewarm water (with the fresh yeast if using fresh yeast) and mix with your hands.
You can also use a rubber spatula if you like.
Bring it all together and knead in the center of the bowl or on a lightly dusted table or board.
After about 5 minutes, it should not be sticky.
It is ready when it's elastic.
If it's rather sticky, add a bit of flour.
Cover the bowl with a moistened and wrung out towel, cover with a plastic bag or plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 5~8 hours for the second rising.
If you're in a hurry, chill for 2 hours.
The dough should rise to about twice the size.
The picture shows dough that has chilled for 5 hours.
Coat your finger with flour and try pressing a hole into it.
Divide into 2 equal pieces and roll into balls.
Cover so that it doesn't dry out and let rest for 20 minutes.
Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, heating your baking pan at the same time.
I use a convection oven that goes up to 250C.
Flatten the rested dough out on kitchen parchment paper.
Press out to 30 cm diameter and top with the toppings.
It will become a bit springier and puffier than your ear.
Slide the pizza with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking pan from the preheated oven.
It'll puff right up.
It'll be done in 10 minutes.
The pictured pizza is topped with tomato sauce, sliced mozzarella, and dried basil.

Original recipe called for 2 tablespoon butter or margarine instead of Wonderslim.
I use the standard bread cycle, light crust setting.
This loaf is milder than whole wheat, but has more character than white bread.
If you choose to use whole wheat flour (which I think would overwhelm the flavor of the spelt), you would need to add a little gluten to help the rise -- maybe one rounded tablespoon.



Heat a griddle or skillet.
Mix all ingredients in a measuring cup or bowl.
Place a small amount of oil, butter, or margarine in the skillet
Pour about 1/3 of the batter into skillet
Cook until bubbly about 60-90 seconds
Flip and cook the same anount of time.
Repeat until all of the batter is used.



Pour beer into a bowl and let stand at room temperature for a few hours to go flat.
Place all ingredients in the pan according to the order in the manufacturer's directions.

Wash unshelled peanuts thoroughly in cold water until water runs clear; then soak in cool, clean water for approximately 30 minutes before cooking.
In a large pot ( I used my pressure cooker), place soaked peanuts and cover completely with water.
Add 1 cup of salt per gallon of water.
Cook, covered, on high heat for 4 to 7 hours.
NOTE: the cooking time of boiled peanuts varies according to the maturity of the peanuts used and the variety of peanuts.
The cooking time for a 'freshly pulled" or green peanut is shorter than for a peanut that has been stored for a time.
Boil the peanuts for about 4 hours, then taste.
Taste again i 10 minutes, both for salt and texture.
Keep cooking and tasting until the peanuts reach desired texture (when fully cooked, the texture of the peanut should be similar to that of a cooked dry pea or bean).
Remove from heat and drain peanuts after cooking or they will absorb salt and become over salted.
Peanuts may be eaten hot or at room temperature, or chilled in the refrigerator and eaten cold, shelling as you eat them.
Freezing boiled peanuts:.
Prepare peanuts as indicated above.
Drain, allow to cool, and freeze in airtight containers.
They keep indefinitely.
Canning Boiled Peanuts:.
Prepare peanuts and brine the same as for boiling for immediate use.
Pack peanuts into jars to within one-half inch of the top, using equal weights of peanuts and hot brine (212F).
Partially submerge containers in upright position in boiling water for 10 minutes.
Seal while hot and process 45 minutes at 10 pounds pressure.
Cool containers in water, label, and store away from heat.



Combine the Rice Krispies and chopped peanut butter cups in a large bowl.
Melt the marshmallows and butter in a large saucepan on low heat.
Dont increase the heat too high or it will burn.
The melting process takes about 20 minutes so patience is key.
Once melted, pour the marshmallow mixture into the Rice Krispie bowl and stir thoroughly to combine.
Grease a 9 x 13 pan and pour the mixture into it.
Press down to compress and level it out.
Next, melt the chocolate and peanut butter.
This is done on the stove top with a double boiler, or by taking 2 pots, and stacking one on top of the other.
The bottom pot will need to contain simmering water, which then heats the top pot and melts the mixture (make sure the water in the bottom pot doesnt touch the bottom of the other pot).
This also takes some time to melt.
Stir occasionally until well combined.
Pour the melted chocolate and peanut butter over the Rice Krispie mix and spread it out evenly.
Place in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes.
I created a swirl pattern on the chocolate with a knife prior to placing in the fridge.
Cut the bars into squares of desired size and serve!

Put the baby spinach in a salad bowl, and toss with just enough of the dressing to lightly coat the spinach.
Sprinkle the sesame seeds, dried cranberries, and sun dried tomatoes, if using, over the top, and serve.
Alternatively, you can arrange the spinach on serving plates, drizzle with the dressing, then add the toppings to each plate.
That way the cranberries and sun dried tomatoes won't sink to the bottom of the bowl, and makes a prettier presentation for a dinner party.

Remove the almonds from the heat and drain.
While the almonds are still warm, remove the skin by pinching individual almonds between your forefinger and thumb.
Leave the skinned almonds to cool.
Make the almond paste.
Process the almonds, sugar and cinnamon in a food processor until the almonds are a powdery mixture which is moist enough to pack.
Add the butter and orange flower water and continue processing until a smooth paste forms around the blade.
Remove the paste from the processor.
Stuff the dates.
Roll small cylinders of almond paste the same length as your dates, but only about 1/3 the diameter.
Take a date, make a vertical cut deep enough to remove the pit, but not so deep as to cut the date in half.
Discard the pit, insert a cylinder of almond paste, and press the sides of the date firmly around the paste, while leaving a portion of paste exposed.
Repeat with the remaining dates and almond paste.
Garnish the dates.
This is an optional step; you might try one of the following methods or be creative and come up with your own:.
Top the exposed paste with a piece of walnut, shredded coconut, or light dusting of cinnamon.
Roll the stuffed date in granulated sugar.
Score the exposed almond paste with the dull side of a paring knife, then roll the date in sugar.
Store the stuffed dates in an airtight container in the fridge.
