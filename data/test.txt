Place all the ingredients in a bowl, and stir until blended.


Turn cooked rice into serving bowl, add basil pesto and toss with fork to fluff and distribute flavor.


Add sugar and 2 cups of water.


Now if you like a skin on top just cover the bowls with plastic wrap but if you want it skinless, then you will have to be sure the wrap is tight and touching the top of the pudding.
