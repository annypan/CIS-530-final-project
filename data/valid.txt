We like our gomasio well toasted to get a really nice nutty flavor.
Some people dont like it toasted that much.
Its a personal thing, you can decide.
Once youve got the color you want, turn off the burner and let it cool down for about 10 minutes.
If you have a lot of time on your hands, the best way to process the gomasio is to use a mortar and pestle.
I prefer the quick method: put the toasted seeds and salt in the food processor, turn it on and let it go for at least a minute, but you dont want it to turn to paste.
Pulse a few times.
Youll have some whole seeds but most will be ground nicely.
Store in an air tight container.

Wrap in plastic and chill it in the freezer (not the refrigerator) for 5 minutes.
Repeat 2 more times.
While the dough is chilling, prepare the molds.
Cut foil into about 22 cm square pieces and stack them.
Place a 10 cm diameter circular mold (or a deep dish) on top, and wrap the foil around it, folding any bits that stick out inside.
The molds are done.
Brush the molds thinly with oil (if you forget this the cakes will stick and won't come out!!).
Cut the topping butter into small pieces, and put the butter pieces and the granulated sugar into the foil molds.
Roll the well chilled dough out thinly, and divide into 6 pieces lengthwise.
(You'll end up with 6 thin ropes.)
Twist each rope with both hands, and coil into the oiled foil molds in a spiral shape.
Mist the rolls lightly with a water sprayer.
Leave in a warm place for about an hour to rise.
In the wintertime leave them in a heated room.
I don't recommend using the bread proofing setting of an oven since the temperature is too high and the butter will melt out.
Preheat the oven to 200C.
When the dough has finished rising, sprinkle them with granulated sugar (not included in the ingredient list).
Bake the rolls once the oven has reached temperature for 22 to 23 minutes.
If the tops have become dark brown, the bottoms should be caramelized, too.
Take the rolls out immediately, and cool them upside down.
They'll be piping hot, so be sure to protect your hands with oven gloves or something.
Let them cool down completely so that the caramelized bits can become crunchy before eating.
The main photo shows them after they've cooled down, with the caramelized tops facing up.

Place your wings on the grill.
Remember, there's lots of honey and sugar in this recipe.
So, don't let the heat get too high and keep the wings turning.

Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8x8 inch (or smaller) pan or line with parchment paper.
Set aside.
For the filling: Combine lemon juice, cornstarch, maple syrup, cinnamon and cardamom in a medium bowl.
Peel and chop pears and add them into the lemon juice mixture.
Carefully stir to coat and set aside.
For the crust: Add 1/2 cup of oats and the almonds and cashews into a blender* and grind until a flour forms.
Add dates and continue to blend until dates are chopped.
Transfer mixture into a bowl.
Mix in baking powder, honey, vanilla extract, coconut, and 1/4 cup of oats (not ground).
Cut in the dairy-free butter with a fork so mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Press about 2/3 of the crumb mixture down into the bottom of the pan with your fingers.
Spoon pear filling over top.
Crumble remaining crumb mixture over top and press down with a spatula.
You may not have enough to completely cover the top.
Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until topping is golden brown.
Remove pan from the oven and allow bars to cool for at least 30 minutes before removing from pan.
*Blender note: If you have a food processor, this may do a better job chopping the dates.
Having said that, I have the cheapest blender available and it still does the job!



Preheat oven to 300 degrees with the rack in the center.
Beat the butter.
Sift in the flour, cornstarch, icing sugar and salt.
Mix until a soft smooth dough forms, just until combined.
Roll half the dough on a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of parchment or wax paper.
Roll out to just over 1/8 inch.
Cut out into 2-inch circles or whatever desired shape.
Place on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining half of the dough.
Bake the cookies for about 15 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through.
You do not want these to brown!
Cool ten minutes on the sheet then move to a wire rack to cool completely.
Spread jam on one cookie and sandwich another on top.



Grease a 9 inch pan with butter or cooking spray.
In a bowl combine all ingredients and microwave on high for 3 minutes.
Stir all ingredients with a spatula.
Microwave on high 2 1/2 minutes more.
Pour into prepared pan and refrigerate to set for at least an hour.
Cut into small peices and enjoy.



1) Boil the anchovies, water, oregano, and salt over high heat for 10 minutes, until the liquid is reduced about one third.
2) Strain the liquamen through a tea strainer once or twice, then add the grape juice.
Pour into a jar.
It will keep for weeks if refrigerated.



Cover ginger with water.
Bring to boil, then let sit without cooking for 12 to 24 hours.
Drain, squeezing out the pulp.
Return to heat.
Boil 5 minutes.
Skim and bottle.
Refrigerate for up to 3 months.



In a medium bowl, combine icing sugar and milk powder.
Stir with wire whisk to blend.
With a pastry blender, cut in peanut butter.
Spoon about 1/3 cup mixture into each 8 small containers or Ziploc bags.
Seal tightly.
Label with date and contents.
Store in cool dry place.
Use within 12 weeks.
To Use:
In a small bowl mix 1 package Butter Cream Frosting with 3/4 teaspoon water.
Stir well with a spoon until smooth and creamy.
Add a drop or two of vanilla if desired.
Each pack makes about 1/4 cup of frosting.



Put the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse several times to mix.
Remove the lid and scatter the butter pieces over the dry ingredients.
Pulse the machine 5 or 6 times to cut in the butter
Remove the lid and fluff the mixture with a fork, lifting it up from the bottom of the bowl.
Scatter the shortening pieces over the flour and pulse the machine 6 or 7 times.
Remove the lid and fluff the mixture again.
Drizzle half of the water over the flour mixture and pulse the machine 5 or 6 times.
Remove the lid, fluff the pastry, and sprinkle on the rest of the water.
Pulse the machine 5 or 6 times more, until the pastry starts to form clumps.
Overall, it will look like coarse crumbs.
Dump the contents of the processor bowl into a large mixing bowl.
Test the pastry by squeezing some of it between your fingertips.
If it seems a little dry and not quite packable, drizzle a teaspoon or so of cold water over the pastry and work it in with your fingertips.
Using your hands, pack the pastry into 2 balls, as you would pack a snowball.
Make one ball slightly larger than the other; this will be your bottom crust.
Knead each ball once or twice, then flatten the balls into 3/4-inch-thick disks on a floured work surface.
Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before rolling.
About 10 minutes before rolling, transfer the pastry to the freezer to make it even firmer.
To mix by hand: Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
Toss well, by hand, to mix.
Scatter the butter over the dry ingredients; toss.
Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour until it is broken into pieces the size of split peas.
Add the shortening and continue to cut until all of the fat is cut into small pieces.
Sprinkle half of the water over the dry mixture; toss well with a fork to dampen the mixture.
Add the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to toss and mix, pulling the mixture up from the bottom of the bowl on the upstroke and gently pressing down on the downstroke.
Pastry made by hand often needs a bit more water, so add it 1 to 2 teaspoons at a time-if it seems necessary-until the pastry can be packed.
Form the pastry into balls, as instructed above, then shape and refrigerate as directed.
Rosemary Semolina Double Crust:
I love this pastry in mixed pear and apple pies.
The rosemary gives the crust a wonderful aroma and savory lift and the semolina adds a bit of crunchy texture and relaxes the pastry, which bakes up very tender.
Follow the directions above, substituting 1/3 cup fine semolina or fine yellow or white cornmeal for 1/3 cup of the flour.
Add 1/2 teaspoon finely crushed dried rosemary to the dry ingredients and proceed as usual.
Note that the pastry may require 1 to 2 tablespoons less water than the basic recipe.



Melt chocolate, set aside to cool.
Cream butter.
beat in cooled chocolate.
Pour into 4 small ramekins and chill until firm.
You may use butter molds-refrigerate for 20 minutes, then pop out and store in plastic bag.
Serve with warm brioche or croissants.
Or even better, serve with Chocolate Bread.



Cook the strawberries in a saucepan over medium heat for about 4 minutes, or until they break down.
Continue to cook and reduce the berries, stirring them occasionally, for 7 to 10 minutes, until very thick and syrupy.
Let the berries cool for 30 minutes, or until they are at room temperature.
Cut the butter into 1-inch pieces and place the pieces into the work bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
Add the cooled berries, the orange zest, and salt.
Starting on slow speed, beat until the ingredients begin to incorporate.
Turn up the speed to medium-high and whip the butter until all the ingredients are incorporated.
The outside of the mixing bowl should feel cool.
If the bowl begins to get too warm, stop the mixer and refrigerate the bowl for 15 minutes before continuing.
When all the ingredients are well mixed, use a spatula to scrape the butter onto a large piece of parchment paper or wax paper.
Roll the butter into a long tube that is 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and twist the ends to seal in the butter.
Chill for at least several hours.
Alternatively, scrape the butter into a ramekin and cover it with plastic wrap before chilling.
The butter can be refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for several weeks.
When you are ready to serve the butter, cut it into rounds and remove the parchment paper.
Alternatively, simply put it on the table in its ramekin.
Substitute equal amounts of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, or fresh currants for the strawberries.
If using currants, add 1 tablespoon sugar to the currants while they are cooking.
Another good trick is to replace the fresh berries with 1/4 cup berry jam and follow all the same steps.
You will still need to heat and cool the jam first.



Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
In the bowl of your stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to beat together the butter and powdered sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the ice water and vanilla bean paste.
(Note: If you dont have vanilla bean paste, substitute 2 teaspoons vanilla extract for the ice water and vanilla bean paste.)
Mix well.
With the mixer on low, slowly add the flour and mix until incorporated.
Do not over mix.
On a lightly floured surface, using half the dough at a time, roll the dough to 1/4 thickness.
Cut into desired shapes, but ensure that you cut as close together as possible.
(The dough can be re-rolled once, but will become tough.)
Place the cut cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets.
Bake for 13 15 minutes until the edges are lightly browned.
Remove the tray from the oven and place on a wire rack.
Use a fine mesh sieve to generously sprinkle with granulated sugar immediately, while the cookies are still warm.
Allow the cookies to cool before gently shaking off the excess sugar.
Recipe adapted from Butter Baked Goods.



Melt butter and mix with cocoa powder.
Alternate adding in powdered sugar and milk, mixing the whole time.
You may have to add more powdered sugar if it needs to be thickened.
Mix in lime juice.



Combine all ingredients.
Let stand 10 minutes.
Press mixture into 8" x 8" baking dish.
Bake at 375 degrees F until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.

Pour grapefruit juice and orange juice into a pitcher and then add grenadine - watching it all fire up like a tequila sunrise.
Add the lime juice and stir to mix.
Keep chilled in the fridge until needed.



Combine all of the ingredients.
Once they have blended together, it's done.
Please adjust the vinegar to taste.
This will of course go well with raw vegetables, but I think it goes even better with boiled veggies.
"Sesame Sauce" This doesn't only need to be used as a sesame sauce, you can arrange it in various ways.
It will be very convenient if you always have this on hand..



Place all ingredients in a covered glass container, cover and shake to mix.
Place in refrigerator overnight (8-12 hours), then eat in the morning!

For each gallon of your pickle crock you need 5 pounds of cabbage and 3 1/2 tablespoons of pickle salt.
(I use a 22 quart dough bucket available in a restaurant supply store and about 40 to 50 pounds of cabbage and get about 30 pints.
).
In your scrupulously clean crock layer 5 pounds of finely shredded cabbage (use your food processor) and 3 1/2 tablespoons of canning and pickling salt.
Keep layering cabbage and salt until the kraut reaches within 5 inches of the top of the crock, pressing down firmly with your hands after each layer.
The kraut will start to make it's own juice.
Scald a clean tea towel or some cheesecloth and tuck it in all around your cabbage.
Put a plate on top of the cloth, and weigh it down with a jar of water.
Put the cover on loosely or cover with a clean tea towel.
Every day remove the jar, plate and cloth and wash. Scald the cloth (30 seconds in the microwave) and skim any scum that comes off the top of the kraut.
DON'T worry if no scum forms for a while.
Sometimes it takes two or three weeks other times it takes a couple of days.
Kraut is funny that way.
Repeat this until no more bubbles rise to the top when you whack the side of your bucket.
When the bubbles stop - the fermentation is completed.
It is easy to see the bubbles rising when you use a plastic dough bucket.
Refrigerate the kraut (who has room in their fridge for all that?)
or process quarts and pints for 20 minutes starting the time from when boiling commences.
After 20 minutes turn off the heat and remove the canner lid and let settle for 5 minutes.
Remove jars carefully to a tray lined with an old bath towel.
Check for seals after 24 hours.
Raw kraut is awesome!
I taste the kraut every day and just love it raw!



Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients.

Stir in tomatoes with their liquid and the dressing.
Cook on low heat until heated through.
Sprinkle with cheese.
Spoon over cooked rice.
Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.



In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and the pepper.
Cut in the butter, using your fingers or a pastry cutter, until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal -- work very quickly so that the butter does not become too warm.
Add the ice water and press the dough gently until it JUST comes together -- DO NOT overmix--it's okay if there appears to be unmoistened flour.
Spread a sheet of plastic wrap over a flat surface and turn the dough out onto it.
Grip the ends of the plastic wrap and pull them together, towards the center, so that the wrap presses the dough together.
Wrap the dough into a ball and refrigerate it for at least 30 minute (At this point, the dough can be wrapped a second time and stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To make the pastry, cut the dough into 2 or 8 equal pieces, depending on whether you will make large or individual galettes.
Set the dough on a floured work surface and use the palm of your hand to pat it flat.
Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle about 1/8-inch thick.
Large galettes should be about 14 inches in diameter - small galettes should be about 6-8 inches in diameter.
Set the dough on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and keep chilled until ready to fill.
(The dough can also be frozen after it has been rolled; be sure to wrap it tightly.
).
Fill with whatever your heart desires and bake in a 400 degrees F oven for about 35-40 min, depending on what you fill it with.
The pastry should be nice and golden brown.
**Variation: For sweet galettes, use 1/4 tsp salt and add 1 tsp sugar at the same time.



Add rolled oats, water and the 1/2 cup milk in a saucepan.
Simmer for 5 minutes.
Test for texture, if you like it with more distinct grains this should be enough.
If not, add a little of the extra milk.
Repeat the test/milk adding once or twice more until the desired consistency.
I usually simmer mine for 7 minutes.
Serve immediately with the golden syrup on top.
The syrup should run down the sides of the porridge, almost disappearing from the top so that the porridge 'swims'.
Enjoy!



Mix oats, raisins, walnuts, sunflower seeds, grape juice, and maple syrup in a microwave-safe bowl.
Cook in microwave oven on High until hot, about 30 seconds.

Be sure to whisk that flour before measuring - I soften the margarine in the micro wave.
Place ingredients in order listed with the flour and yeast going in last.
Choose your cycle.During the first mixing check to assure your dough has the right amount of flour and water - dough should look nice and shiny.Flours differ so you may need to add lukewarm water a teaspoon at a time if it is too dry- a sprinkling of flour if too sticky.
Never add more then 3 tablespoons of either the flour or the water.
In my breadmaker the whisked flour and the carefully measured ingredients are right on.
Makes a large loaf.
FOR DOUGH use dough cycle - when cycle complete shape into bread, buns or rolls.
I often make braided loaves topping with sesame seeds.
Brush tops with softened butter or margarine.Rise 20 to 30 minutes or until double in size.
Bake in a 350 oven until nicely golden brown brushing with softened butter or margarine just before they are done - I brush them again when I take them out - makes for nice tops.
Time varies - check your machine.
Cooking time is machine and baking time.



In a small bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder.

Bake in an oven preheated to 375 F for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped.



Mix warm water with salt.
Place couscous into an oven-safe dish.
Gradually add salted water, stirring vigorously so that it is absorbed evenly.
Leave to swell for about 10 minutes, then mix in oil and rub the couscous between your hands above the bowl to air it and break up any lumps.
That is the important part.
Put the dish in an oven preheated to 400F and heat through for 20 minutes, or until it is steaming hot.
Before serving, work in butter and fluff it up again, breaking up any lumps.



In a blender, puree the yogurt with 1 Tbsp of the lime juice until smooth.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl.
In the same blender, puree the raspberries with the remaining lime juice
and sugar.
Pour the yogurt mixture and the berry puree in layers into popsicle molds.
Using a wooden popsicle stick, swirl the layers together.
Insert sticks, then freeze the pops for at least 6 hours.



Combine the ingredients in a bowl with a whisk.
Then mix in the vinegar and pour the batter into some muffin cups.
I'm using 7 silicon muffin cups that are 1.5 cm deep.
Fill a 24 cm diameter frying pan with 0.7-1 cm water and place the muffin cups inside.
Then cover the pan with a lid and steam the bread over medium-high heat.
When the water starts boiling, turn the heat to low and steam the bread for a further 6-7 minutes.
Test the bread to see if it's done by inserting a skewer or toothpick in the center.
If no raw batter gets stuck to it, it's ready.
You can still make this steamed bread in about 10 minutes even when using larger cups.
This steamed bread is nice and fluffy because sodium bicarbonate in the baking powder reacts with the acetic acid in the vinegar to make carbon dioxide gas.
It also produces carbonic acid which then splits into gas and water.
Variation: You can replace the sugar with brown sugar and add some walnuts to make some traditional gantsuki.



Put all ingredients into food processor.
Process just enough to mix everything, maybe 30 seconds, just so that when you pinch some of the mixture it sticks together.
If you prefer a more chewy type of brownie, the more you process it, the more chewy and less cake-like it will be.
It can get quite fudgy if you process it longer.
We prefer it processed less, and more cake-like.
Try it different ways and discover what you like best!
Press mixture into pan, and refrigerate for a couple of hours.
Cut into squares and store in airtight container in fridge or freezer.
Note: We have eaten this many times right from the food processor.
It will sometimes be a little crumbly this way, which is why the refridgeration is recommended to set the mixture.
Optional: You can also use raw carob powder instead of the raw cacao powder, or you can use 1/8 cup of each.



Peel the potatoes and slice as thinly as possible on a mandoline directly into a large, 8-quart container filled with 4 quarts of cold water.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Drain the potatoes and rinse with clean, cold water; spin dry in a salad spinner.
Transfer the potatoes to an 11-quart pot, cover with the milk and set over medium heat.
Bring to a simmer, about 35 minutes.
Reduce the heat in order to maintain a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the potatoes are fork tender and beginning to fall apart, 25 to 30 minutes.
Reserve 1 cup of the cooking milk.
Drain the potatoes thoroughly in a colander and return them to the pot.
Press the potatoes through a ricer into a large mixing bowl.
Add the reserved hot milk, butter and salt and use an electric hand mixer to whip on low speed for 15 to 30 seconds.
Do not overwhip.



Cut kielbasa into 2-inch slices.
Place in a large skillet with the ginger ale (regular, this does not work with diet ginger ale).
Bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium.
Do not cover pan.
After 15 to 20 minutes, ginger ale will be reduced and start to caramelize.
WATCH CAREFULLY because you dont want it to burn.
At this point, keep stirring until chunks are glazed.
Serve on a platter with toothpicks inserted.
They are sticky and yummy!

Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake in a 350-degree oven until lightly toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine all the ingredients except the pecans and vanilla extract in a 4-quart glass bowl.
Heat in a microwave oven on high power for 5 minutes.
Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully transfer the bowl to a countertop and stir with a heat-resistant spatula.
Return to microwave and heat for 5 more minutes.
Stir in the pecans and heat for another 5 minutes.
Stir and check the temperature with a digital or candy thermometer.
If it reads 240 degrees, proceed to Step 4.
If not, continue heating on high power, stirring and checking the temperature every minute until it does.
Remove from oven and let the mix sit undisturbed.
After 20 minutes, add the vanilla extract and stir vigorously until it becomes cloudy and creamy.
Using 2 spoons, scoop and shape into 2-inch-diameter mounds on a baking sheet lined with foil, parchment paper or a silicone mat.
If the mix becomes too hard to shape, reheat for 15 seconds.
Let the pralines rest for 30 minutes.
Keep stored in an airtight container.



Put ingredients into a blender and blend until completely smooth.
Serve in plastic cups with swivel straw, if available.

Divide drained peaches (if large slice finer) between 2 small oven proof dishes.
Roast hazelnuts - put on a tray and roast in a 160 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes and then removed and place in a clean towel and rub to remove skins (In doing this I removed about 1/2 the skins and just coarsely chopped the nuts in a mini processor with skins that were left on and it was still good).
Mix hazelnuts with oats in a small container.
Mix 2 teaspoons of reserved juice and maple syrup and heat in a microwave proof container (about 20 seconds at 50% heat in a 900 Watt microwave) - the original recipe suggested heating in a small pan, my suggestion if you do not have a microwave is put the maple syrup and juice in a heat proof container and heat in a water bath on top of the stove.

Tap the mold on a countertop a few times to eliminate air pockets.
Let the chocolate sit in the mold at room temperature for 3 minutes.
Turn the mold upside down over a sheet of parchment or waxed paper and let the chocolate run out.
This will leave a thin film of chocolate coating each cavity of the mold.
With a small flexible-blade spatula, clean off the edges of each cavity of the mold.
Place a hazelnut in each cavity.
Fit a 12-inch pastry bag with a large, plain round pastry tip with a 1/2-inch opening and fill partway with the hazelnut truffle cream.
Pipe the truffle cream into each cavity, filling it just below the top edge.
Fill up the mold cavity with the remaining tempered chocolate.
With a small flexible-blade spatula, clean off the edges of each cavity, if necessary.
Place the mold in the freezer until the chocolate is set (15 minutes).
Remove the mold from the freezer and turn it upside down over a piece of parchment or waxed paper.
Hold the mold by opposite corners and gently twist it in opposite directions.
The candies should drop out of the mold.
If they dont drop out easily, return the mold to the freezer for another 15 minutes and try again.
Place the kisses in paper candy cups.
In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the kisses will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer.

Arrange nuts in a single layer on a nonstick foil lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10-12 minutes at 375F or until the syrup begins to darken (be careful not to burn it!
).
Allow to cool in a single layer so they don't stick to each other.



Place the peanut butter cereal, pretzels, rice krispies and marshmallows in a large bowl and combine them.
In a microwave safe bowl melt the chocolate on high power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each 30 seconds.
Pour melted chocolate over cereal mixture and stir to completely and evenly coat.
Pour mixture on waxed paper and let harden.
Once hardened, break into small pieces and store in an airtight container.



Heat 3 tablespoons of margarine in a large saute pan over medium heat.
When bubbling, add the fruit and saute 4 to 6 minutes until softened.
Stir in all remaining ingredients and put set aside to cool on the counter or in the refrigerator.
When cool, fill crepes with desired amount.



Place cut potatoes in a bowl of water and let soak for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil and spray with cooking spray; set aside.
Dry potatoes off.
In a shallow bowl, add egg white and water; mix together until foamy.
In another shallow bowl, add bread crumbs and spices; mix well together.
I squeezed the mixture between my hands to crush up the bread crumbs a pinch more.
Dip the potatoes in egg white, then into bread crumbs and place on to prepared baking sheet.
Do the same for remaining potatoes.
Bake in oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping potatoes halfway through cooking time.
Cook the potatoes until crispy.

Enjoy!



Measure ingredients into baking pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer.
Select sweet cycle.



Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12 inch skillet over high heat until smoking.
Meanwhile, toss shrimp, salt, pepper, and sugar in medium bowl.
Add half of shrimp to pan in single layer and cook until spotty borwn and edges turn pink, about 1 minute.
Remove pan from heat; using tongs, flip each shrimp and let stand until all but very center is opaque.
Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and shrimp; after second bath has stood off heat, return first batch to skillet and toss to combine.
Cover skillet and let satnd until shrimp are cooked through 1 to 2 minutes.
Serve immediately.



Mix starter or poolish ingredients in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel.
Leave to ferment at room temperature for 7 to 8 hours until bubbly and swollen in size.
Add the starter or polish to the mixing bowl of a mixer or to a large bowl.
To that add the water, honey, flour, salt (on one side of the bowl) and yeast (on opposite side of the bowl.
Using a dough hook on the lowest setting (or by hand), mix all ingredients until well mixed (2 to 3 minutes) and turn off the mixer.
Cover the bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.
Knead with the dough hook on the lowest setting (or by hand), for 5 minutes and tip out onto a lightly floured counter.
Stretch the dough into a large rectangle and fold letter-style, top to middle, bottom over top and side to side.
Place in an oiled, straight-sided clear container and cover.
After 15 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold procedure and cover again.
Let rise at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes until the dough is 1 1/2 times as large as it was initially or doubled in volume.
Divide into 16 equal pieces and roll each into round balls.
Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F.
Press each ball with thumb and forefinger to form a hole and use fingers to roll and stretch the bagels until the holes are about 2 inches in diameter.
Place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper sprayed well with vegetable oil spray.
This prevents the wet bagels from becoming one with the parchment.
Cover with oiled plastic and let rise for 15 to 20 minutes or until one of the bagels floats in a bowl of cold water.
Meanwhile prepare the boiling bath by mixing all ingredients and bringing to a light boil.
Also bring out the sesame seeds, rehydrated onion flakes, poppy seeds or whatever the toppings are you choose.
I like to rehydrate onion flakes and toast the sesame seeds before making the bagels.
Boil each bagel (4 to 5 at a time if you can without crowding the pan) for 1 minute and flip the bagels with a slotted spoon to boil on the opposite side for 1 minute as well.
Remove with the slotted spoon and return the boiled and swollen bagels to their parchment paper.
Put toppings on the wet bagels and bake at 450 F for 6 to 7 minutes, rotate the pans and bake for another 6 to 7 minutes being careful not to over-brown the bagels.
Bagels should be dark golden in color.
Place bagels on a cooling rack and let cool before slicing.



Sift together the flour, cornstarch (sugar if using) and salt.
Rub in the butter until it resembles fine crumbs (can be done in a processor; use high speed).
Dissolve the cream of tartar in the water, and add to the crumbly mixture.
Again you'll need high speed to bring the mixture together into a dough.
Turn out into a bowl if you used a processor.
The pastry should be very easy to handle.
If at all necessary, add a few drops more water, but be careful.
When the consistency is right, it does not stick to your hands and feels silky soft but firm.
Cover with clingfilm, and refrigerate until 15 minutes before you need it, or otherwise about 20 - 30 minutes.
Mariette's instructions were to roll out between clingfilm, but that should not be necessary.
I simply sprinkle flour on my granite counter and roll out 1/2 the pastry to start with -- easier to control.
As you cut it to whatever shape you want, gather the bits together, press into a roll, and roll out again.
Use dough to line loose-bottomed small pastry tins, or a 9 - 11 inch (26 - 28 cm) diameter loose-bottomed springform cake tin.
Simply add your prepared filling, and bake at 350 deg.
F (180 deg C) or as recipe indicates.
It's best baked set on an oven tin with a dark finish, which ensures a well-baked bottom crust.
Any leftover dough can be frozen.
* For an exotic touch, add 2 teaspoons of the small black cardamom seeds to the dry mixture, at the start,.



Heat oil over low heat, add onions and cook very slowly, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.
Cover and chill for 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 350oF.
Lightly grease cookie sheets.
On a floured surface roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
Using 1 3/4 inch round cookie cutters (or whatever you want to use) cut out cookies and place 1 1/2 inches apart on cookie sheet.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes until dry looking and firm to the touch.
Transfer to wire racks to cool.
Decorate with frosting if desired.
Number of cookies depends on size of cutters -- this makes a lot.
Prep time includes chiling time.



Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
Place the popped popcorn, peanuts, and cranberries in two large roasting pans.
In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and butter over medium heat.

Add the buttermilk (or water, if using buttermilk powder) and 2 tablespoons of the butter and stir until just combined.
Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth (it will still be very sift and a little sticky, but should be smoother and less lumpy).
Flatten the dough into a rectangle about 12 inches by 8 inches.
Pour 2 tablespoons of the melted butter on and spread around with your fingers.
Pour the filling over though dough and spread it evenly over the top, leaving about a 1/2 inch or so border around the outside edge.
Press the filling down to sort of pack it on top of the dough.
Starting on the long side of the dough, roll the side up, pressing as you go, to create a tightly rolled log (be gentle, as this will likely stick to the counter a bit).
Pinch the seam closed and lay the log seam side down.
Cut into 8 even pieces, laying each one flat as you go.
Gently press down on the top of each roll, then transfer them to the prepared cake pan.
Brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.
To make the icing: In a medium bowl, cream the cream cheese and add the sugar.
Mix until the sugar and cream cheese start to come together a bit.
Add the buttermilk and whisk well, until the mixture is smooth.
Allow the cinnamon rolls to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack set over parchment paper.
Pour the frosting over the cinnamon rolls.
Serve these while theyre still warm.
These will keep in an airtight container for at least 3 days.

If your dish is broiler-safe, run it under the broil for a minute or two to get it extra-crispy.



Pre-heat grill according to your grill's instructions.
(If using an electric, gas, or indoor grill, this step can probably be performed as a later step, since those may only take 5-10 minutes to pre-heat.
).
Rinse and thoroughly dry steaks.
If you wish, you can pound the steaks with a meat mallet to tenderize the steaks by breaking down the meat fibers.
Apply rub to both sides of each steak, working the rub well into each side--feel free to use less of the rub, or to alter the amounts of the seasonings above according to your personal preference, too--the amount above is ample enough that it can also be "stretched" to season up to 4 small steaks.
Let the rubbed steaks rest on a plate at room temperature for 1-hour before grilling.
You can cover the steaks with an inverted paper plate or regular plate while those are resting, but avoid plastic wrap which the seasonings would stick to when removed.
Grill steaks according to your preference and let those rest on a plate for a couple of minutes or so before serving.
Note: A little trick many restaurants employ, is to top each steak with a small pat of butter when the meat is plated, to give the steaks a nice sheen and accentuate the juices.
The rubbed steaks tend to be juicy and very flavorful grilled with only the rub on them, but it's a nice trick to know in case you suspect you may have gotten an inferior quality of beef, or wish to add an extra special touch for some occasion.

* Spread your sesame seeds on a roasting tray, and toast in the oven for 15 minutes, stir occasionally to toast evenly.
Do not allow to brown as this impairs the flavor.
* Remove the sesame seeds from the oven and allow to cool briefly.
* Put the toasted sesame seeds in your blender and add half the oil.
* Blend the mixture, adding additional oil gradually to form a smooth paste.
Add more oil if needed for smooth consistency but make sure that it is still a paste and not too thin.
* When the mixture is evenly smooth, and further blending does not further refine the texture, transfer your tahini to a tight fitting glass jar using a flexible spatula, if you have one, to reduce waste.
Tahini may be kept in the refrigerator for many weeks in a well-sealed jar.

I used So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk (found in the refrigerated section).
If you use a thinner milk, such as rice milk, it may take more time before it cooks down enough.
Use a 1 2 quart slow cooker for this one ( or multiply recipe and use larger one).
You want to reduce the volume by half.
If you use a thinner milk to begin with it will take more time.
So one way to find out the point where youve reduced volume to half is to actually put the milk into a measuring cup about half way through the process.
After 4 hours on high I poured mine in the measuring cup to check and it had reduced to 1 1/2 cups, after 2 more hours it was a little over 1 cup.
Being coconut milk the solids were perfect.
I havent tested this with any other milk yet, so please let me know if you do.
Now go out and veganize some of your childhood favorites, and let me know how it goes!



Take your cereal and place a cup in a container.
Add portions of your apple sauce over each layer of cereal.
If you like a lot of sauce then you can increase the apple sauce or if you like a little more crunch and less sogginess than vice versa.
Let the concoction sit to moisten or eat it right up.
I have had it chilled, warmed, and room temperature.
It all depended on mood and what I craved.
Cinnamon is optional.
I also think that if you want extra sweet apple sauce it would not be a problem to add sugar.
Enjoy!

Cut leaves from beetroot, but leave some stem on so as to stop leeching of the colour during cooking.
Boil the beetroot in a saucepan for at least 45 minutes Do not test by pricking with fork or the colour will leech.
Keep lid on whilst simmering to stop the red water from splashing and staining the cooktop.
When beetroot is ready, drain liquid and fill saucepan with cold water to stop the cooking.
Remove the outer skin of beetroot by hand under running cold water.
Remove the dark scarred tissue that was connected to the leaf stems.
Leave beetroot in a bowl to cool down further.
Using a hand grater, select the finest holes to grate the beetroot into a bowl.
Be careful of your fingers.
The inside of the beetroot may still be hot and could burn your fingers.
DO NOT use the coarse or scalloped holes of the grater as this will make the texture too chunky.
If the beetroot is woody, then grate around the woody core and discard the core.
Do not use an electric blender as this will totally whip the beetroot and add air to the mixture.
This will ruin the texture.
In a deep skillet, slowly melt the butter, stir in and dissolve the sugar, add the flour and stir into a paste.
Add the vinegar, stir quickly and add the grated beetroot.
Stir quickly to stop any sticking on the base of the skillet.
Over a low heat, gradually stir the mixture and taste.
The taste must be balanced over the whole tongue.
If you cannot taste sweetness on the front of the tongue, add a little sugar, stir and taste again.
Repeat until you just taste the sweetness.
Next, try to taste for sour.
This will be the tang you feel at the side and back of the mouth.
If you do not feel any "tang" then add a little more vinegar, stir and taste again.
Repeat until the balance of sweet and sour satisfies the palate.
Remove from heat until ready to serve.
The mixture can be frozen at this point and reheated when needed.
When ready to serve, reheat slowly and add the sour cream.
The sour cream will enhance the flavour.

Once the pieces of lard are small, add the cold ginger ale.
Blend liquid in just until the dough begins to hold together.
Overworking toughens the dough.
Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on how thick or thin you like your pie crusts.
Wrap each piece in a sheet of plastic wrap.
Chill the dough for 30 minutes for easier rolling.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F then roll out the dough.
Rolling out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper makes for a cleaner kitchen, but you can always roll it out on a floured surface.
(I keep my wooden rolling pin in the freezer at all times too.)
Put the dough into your pie plates.
Ive heard that chilling the dough in the pie plate before baking helps it from shrinking, so thats what I do.
(This is why I have the prep time set at 1 hour.)
Baked alone at 375 degrees F, it takes about 12-15 minutes.
If there is a filling, bake for about 30 minutes.
To keep from burning the edges, use the foil method.
(Put foil around the edges and remove about ten minutes before the cooking time is done, so they can get golden).



Combine brown sugar and mustard in 3-4 quart crockpot.
Add kielbasa and stir evenly to coat, cover and cook on low 2.5 to 3 hours.
Stir occasionally until heated through and glazed.



Make your simple syrup ahead of time so it has time to cool.
Place sugar, water and corn syrup in a pot and cook over medium to low heat until sugar dissolves.
Let cool.
Cut up and pit your cherries.
Pour the cooled syrup, your cherries and the yogurt into a food processor and pulse until you are happy with the consistency of it.
Pour into popsicle moulds (should make around 8, but depends on the size of your moulds).
Freeze for at least 4 hours.
Remove from freezer and serve with a smile.



In a mixing bowl, mix together brown sugar with cornstarch.
Add blueberries to sugar mixture and stir until well coated.
Spoon blueberry mixture into a 9 inch x 9 inch microwave safe dish.
Microwave on HIGH (full power) uncovered for 3 1/2 minutes for fresh blue berries or 6 minutes if using frozen blueberries.
Blueberry sauce should be thick and bubbly.
Stir once half way through cooking.
TOPPING-----------.

Add the butter and combine on low speed until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 3 minutes.
Add the molasses and 1/4 cup of water and mix until the dough forms a ball, about 2 minutes.
Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, pat each piece into a flat 4-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap.
Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.
Roll out each piece of chilled dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper into two 8-inch squares about 1/8 inch thick.
Transfer each square, on the parchment, to a baking sheet; stack and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.
Remove the top sheets of parchment and, using a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares (you'll get 16 cookies from each square of dough).
Prick the dough all over with a fork and bake until golden around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes.
Let the cookies cool completely on a rack, then break them apart into squares.
Freeze 12 squares in a resealable bag until firm, about 15 minutes; reserve the remaining cookies for another use.
Place the chilled graham squares on a work surface and turn them bottom side up.
Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the Fluff in the center of 6 squares, and about 2 tablespoons of the ice cream on the remaining 6 squares, then gently sandwich the squares together.
Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
In a microwavable bowl, melt the chocolate chips in a microwave at 50 percent power for 3 minutes.
Stir until smooth; let rest until cool to the touch.
Dip the ice cream sandwiches in the melted chocolate, turning with tongs to coat.
Place each bonbon on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour.



In a large bowel, place all ingredients;.
Stir until well mixed.

Place chips and shortening in medium microwave safe bowl and microwave on high or 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until smooth when stirred.
Stir in nuts.
Spoon heaping teaspoonful of mixture into 1" paper candy cups.
Refrigerate until firm.
Peel off paper cups, if desired.



Put the granulated sugar in a small pot, and heat while stirring until white smoke comes up.
When it has all melted, browned a bit, and white smoke comes out, turn off the heat.
(If you let it brown too much, it will become hard candy.)
Next, you'll add the heavy cream, but it will bubble, so do it without rushing so as not to let it splatter.
Divide the heavy cream into 3 portions and add one portion at a time.
Mix until well combined.
It's done!
It's delicious whether hot or cold!
Have it as you like.
It'll feel creamy when it's hot and heavier when cold.
If it hardens, microwave for a few seconds to warm up.



In a bowl, stir together the ketchup, mustard powder, garlic powder, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and pineapple (optional).
Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to blend the flavors before serving.
Store leftovers in refrigerator.



Mix all ingredients well in a bowl and transfer to a dipping dish.
Serve with boiled or grilled shrimps or prawns.



To toast nuts, heat and stir over medium heat till toasted.
Or carefully heat in the microwave for a few minutes.
Nuts tend to burn easily so toast with caution and stir and turn frequently.
Then stir nuts with remainder of ingredients and mix well.
Microwave on high power for 7 minutes, stirring once.
Then pour mixture on a sheet of foil and let cool completely.
Break up nut mixture and stir in a cool dry place.
Note: made in a 650/700 watt microwave oven, so adjust time if needed.

Roll dough out to fit a 9 inch pie plate.
Place crust in pie plate.
Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate.



In a food processor, combine flour, yeast, olive oil, and salt.
With the food processor on, slowly (over 30 seconds) start pouring in 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of warm water.
Stop adding water when the dough form a single ball.
If you add too much water and the dough gets sticky, just add a bit more flour.
Leave the food processor on for about 10 more seconds to knead the dough a bit.
Place the dough ball in a floured bowl, cover it with a towel, and allow it to rise for about an hour.
After an hour, reform the risen dough into a ball.
Divide it into four equal parts and either freeze it or allow it to relax for immediate use.
To freeze: Place each dough ball in a zip-top bag and put in the freezer.
The morning that you are going to use the dough, remove it from the freezer and place it in the fridge to thaw.
About 30 minutes before making the pizza, take it out of the baggie and allow it to relax on the counter, covered with plastic wrap.
To use immediately: Cover each dough ball with plastic wrap, and let them sit on the counter for another 30 minutes to relax.
To stretch the dough, gently press it out on the counter into a circle shape, about half the size of the final pizza.
Then drape the dough over both of your knuckles and rotate it around, allowing it to stretch itself to a larger circle, about 10 inches in diameter.
If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for about 5 minutes, at which point it will stretch more easily.

NOTE: 1 bag of (1 pound) frozen meatballs is only about 18 to 20 larger size meatballs.
That is perfect for a small get-together.
But if youre going to a larger party, you might want to get TWO bags of meatballs, and in that case you would then DOUBLE the above recipe.
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except your meatballs.
Mix up really well.
Place your frozen meatballs into your crock pot, and pour the whiskey sauce in on top.
Mix it up all around so each meatball is coated with the whiskey sauce.
Now turn up the heat to high.
Leave it on high for about an hour, stirring a couple times.
Once it appears that the meatballs have somewhat thawed, go ahead and turn your crockpot down to low.
You dont want to burn all that wonderful whiskey sauce!
Thats the best part!
Boy these are so good!
Now I know where whiskey-a-go-go came from!



Thoroughly clean beets, place in a large pan and cover with water.

Combine all ingredients in heavy pan on med heat.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low.
Simmer uncovered 50 min, or until all liquid is gone and mixture is very sticky.
(Don't cook it too fast or it won't be sticky enough to hold together-- if liquid is gone and mixture doesn't seem to stick, add a little more water and continue simmering.)
Stir periodically throughout and then frequently near end of cooking time to prevent scorching.
Remove from heat, place in covered container, and chill thoroughly, preferably overnight.
To cook burgers: Preheat skillet on medium, spray lightly with non-stick spray if desired.
Wet hands lightly and shape patties from approx 1/2 cup chilled mixture each.
Cook until browned on both sides-- turn carefully!



Throw all ingredients into a bowl and mix together with a food processor (using dough hooks) or by hand.
The dough will be fairly sticky but don't add any more flour.
Instead scrape it into an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth and leave to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.
I like to let my dough rise in an ever-so-slightly warmed oven or in an airing cupboard.
When dough is finished rising, pre-heat oven to 400 F degrees.
Turn onto a floured surface and work in a bit more flour until the dough loses its stickiness -- you shouldn't need too much -- then roll out to desired size, keeping the dough about 1/2 inch thick.
Leave to rise for about 10 minutes, before topping with your favourite ingredients.
Put on a baking sheet sprinkled with flour or cornmeal and bake for 10-15 minutes in a very hot oven until lightly browned.

Preheat oven to 275 deg F.
Spread the cubes out in a deep baking dish, place in oven.
Stir every once in a while as the fat renders into a clear liquid.
When the baking dish contains only clear liquid and browned bits (about 2 hours), carefully remove the dish from the oven (letting the cracklings color richly gives the lard a fuller, roastier flavor).
Let the lard cool to lukewarm, then strain.
Store the lard in a tightly sealed jar in the refrigerator (freeze if you won't use it all within a month).



In a large bowl combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oil, baking soda, and salt.

Make the pastry: Set aside a small bowl of ice water.
On a work surface, mound flour, salt and sugar, and mix to blend.
Top with frozen butter and lard or shortening, and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until it resembles coarse meal; some large pieces of the fats should still be visible.
Quickly form a mound and, with your finger, draw a trench down the center.
Sprinkle trench with 1 tablespoon ice water and fluff flour so it absorbs the water.
Repeat three times, drawing trenches and sprinkling each with 1 tablespoon ice water, so 4 tablespoons of water have been incorporated.
The dough should be starting to clump in large pieces.
If necessary, add water by droplets until dough begins to form a mass.
Gather dough with a pastry scraper.
Working quickly, use the heel of your hand to smear an egg-size piece of dough by pushing it away from you.

Bake as hot as possible (if you have the right equipment, 900-1,000 Fahrenheit) until crust is darkened and toppings bubble (2-3 minutes if cooking at 900 Fahrenheit).



In a heavy bottom saucepan (5 cup pan or larger), stir together the sugar, corn syrup and water.
Let the water soak into the sugar until completely moist.
Heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and mixture is bubbling.
Stop stirring and allow mixture to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber color (about the color of an amber beer).
Once you have achieved the desired color, immediately remove mixture from heat.
Slowly add in your warmed heavy cream.
Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula and begin to slowly stir the mixture until smooth.
Make sure to scrape the thicker parts at the bottom and mix in so you get a nice smooth consistency.
If you begin to get lumps, put mixture back on stove and heat for a moment.
Remove and re-stir.
When mixture is complete add in Vanilla and Salt.
NOTES: Will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Microwaves vary, but I nuked my omelette at 50% power for 6-7 minutes and it came out evenly cooked and smelling delicious.
I tested it by touching the middle part and making sure it felt a little firm to the touch (no liquid mix remained underneath the cooked portion).
Top with Jam or Jelly, or PB2.
Whatever you like.

Bake for 1-1/2 hours, stirring every 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven and break up any large clumps.
Cool completely.
Notes: 1.
Mixed nuts as called for in the recipe would be superbly delicious, however I used Virginia peanuts and Marcona almonds in my batchvarieties which are kid friendly in my house.
Of course you may use your favorite nuts, or none at all.
2.
Though I have full commercial-sized sheet pans, I found my large roasting pan, the one used for turkey, made it easier to stir and turn the caramel corn between intervals.
This way, the corn and nuts remained in the pan without spilling out.
3.
Apply a light spritz of non-stick cooking spray to the surface of the spoon you use to stir the corn during baking; it helps to keep the kernels from sticking to the spoon.
Dont be too concerned about coating each kernel and nut with the caramel...the baking and stirring process helps to disperse the candy coating.

Wipe a 12 x 18-inch plastic cutting board with a wet cloth and place a 12 x 18-inch piece of acetate on top (the damp surface will keep the acetate from moving around).
Smooth the acetate out completely.
Pour the chocolate into the center of the acetate and use a large offset spatula to spread the chocolate into an even layer that covers the acetate completely.
Make long, even sweeps with the spatula, from the center out to the sides and corners.
When the chocolate starts to set but is not yet hard, follow these instructions to make squares, rectangles, or swirls.
To make squares or rectangles: Score the chocolate into 2 1/2-inch squares or 1 1/2 x 3-inch rectangles with the back of a knife (you dont want to cut through the acetate).
Cover the chocolate with a piece of parchment, transfer it to a baking sheet, and weight it with another baking sheet.

Place flour and wheat gluten into the bowl of a large food processor and process briefly to mix.
(Check your food processor manual to make sure your processor is powerful enough to process bread dough and to determine how much flour your processor can handle.
If necessary, process this recipe in two batches).
I use a 14 cup Cuisinart processor.
(Note: vital wheat gluten is available in bulk or boxes at health food stores).
Add oil to processor and process briefly to mix.
.
Start processor and slowly pour liquid through the feed tube.
You may need more or less liquid depending on the type of flour and the humidity.
Within about 30 to 60 seconds the mixture should form a ball.
If it doesn't, add more water or flour (whichever is necessary) for the dough to form a ball.
After the dough forms a ball, process for an additional 30 to 60 seconds until smooth and elastic.
Do not overprocess because processing causes the dough to heat up and it might heat up so much that you kill the yeast.
When making 100 percent whole wheat bread in my processor, it helps to use a dinner knife to "premix" the dough.
Pour the liquid into the bowl (without the processor running) and mix briefly with a dull knife until most of the flour is moistened.
Then process as above.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and form into a ball.
This is your opportunity to ensure that the dough has the proper ratio of flour to liquid.

1.
Mix the milk, sugar, vanilla, salt and peanut butter together in a blender or with a hand mixer until the peanut butter is completely mixed in with the milk.
2.
Stir in the cream.
3.
Pour into your ice cream maker and freeze according to freezer instructions.
(If you only have a small 1 quart freezer, you may need to freeze a little in a second batch.)
4.
When the ice cream is close to the desired thickness, start melting the milk chocolate chips in a small sauce pan over low heat, stirring constantly.
5.
When ice cream is done, transfer it to a container that you can freeze the ice cream in but is big enough to allow mixing room (about a 6 cup capacity should work).
6.
Drizzle the melted chocolate over the ice cream and fold the chocolate into the ice cream being careful not to stir too much but working quickly to minimize melting.
7.
Transfer ice cream to a freezer and let the ice cream set up for about 1 hour.
(Of course you can eat it right away, but we found it works better to let it freeze up a little before.)
Enjoy!

Heat Oil up in a sauce pan, heavy or medium sauce pan will do.
Brown the Rice.
Here is where you have to be careful make sure you constantly stir the rice while browing it.
The rice is done browning when its has taken a white opaque color, and if you can smell a sweet musty smell coming from the pot.
Add the Hot Water, Tomatoe Sauce, and Chicken Bouillon to the rice.
(Optional) taste water mixture add more Bouillon to taste if you want more.
Cover and let it cook over medium heat.
Stir contents from time to time to make sure rice does not stick to bottom of pot.
Rice is done when you either the idividiual rice grains are butterfly slit down the middle.
Or when you no longer see anymore white whole grains.
Most of the time the water gets absorved by the rice or it evaporates leaving you nice cooked rice behind.



Crust:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Spray pie plate with nonstick spray.
Whisk together dry ingredients (flour, 1 teaspoon salt, baking powder).
Blend in cold butter cubes until it forms a meal consistency.
Blend in 3/4 cup of whole milk (you may need slightly more, depending on the texture).
This should form a biscuit-like dough.
Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half.
Roll out the first half of dough to fit your pie plate (usually about 12 round).
I roll the dough right on a well-floured counter, but you can use waxed paper or plastic wrap, if you prefer.
Its a pretty sticky dough, so youll probably need extra flour with any method.
Place the rolled-out crust in your pie plate and trim off any excess.
You can roll out the second crust now or put the dough in the fridge and roll it right before you place it on top of the filling.
I usually par-bake the bottom crust for about 8 to 10 minutes to avoid sogginess.
Filling:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Add onions and saute until edges are clear and soft.
Add cubed chicken and brown.
Add broccoli (if using frozen, you may want to nuke it for a few minutes first) and stir.
Add shredded cheese, cream of mushroom soup, milk and stir together.
Heat for a few minutes to thicken.
Pour the warm filling into the bottom crust.
Place the top crust over the filling and pinch the edges to close.
Brush the top crust with 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle a few pinches of kosher salt.
Be sure to cut steam vents in the top crust after.
Bake for about 25 minutes or until crust is golden on edges and filling is bubbling slightly.

).
Knead the dough for about 4 or 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic.
(While you're kneading, you can get creative and add in some herbs or spices, but only if you want to do that).
Be careful not to over-knead the dough.

Dissolve the salt in the water.
Add to the flour in 3 batches, and fold it in with a spatula from the bottom of the bowl.
When the mixture is crumbly, press down with your hands while gathering in the flour to put it together.
Add a bit more water if needed.
When the dough has come together, knead with your palms really well.
By doing so, the dough will become firm and elastic.
While incorporating the dusted flour, adjust the consistency to the firmness of your earlobe.
When the surface has become smooth, wrap in cling film, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes.
The dough will become moist and easier to roll out.
I recommend preparing the toppings while you're waiting.
Dust a work surface with flour, divide the dough in half, and shape them into balls.
Press the dough flat onto the work surface.
Roll out back and forth and side to side with a rolling pin.
If you roll the dough onto the rolling pin diagonally at the end, the dough will become rectangular.
When the dough is about 3 mm thick, dust the dough with flour, fold it into thirds, and cut with a knife.
The noodles will expand when they're boiled, so they should be on the narrow side.
It's ok even if the width of the noodles is uneven.
Take your time!
Loosen the noodles, and dust with flour.
Prepare the soup.
Cook the noodles in plenty of hot water.
Stir only a few times at the beginning.
After 10-13 minutes, when the noodles have floated to the surface, drain in a colander.
Wash the noodles well with cold running water to remove the sliminess.
By doing so, the noodles will be firmer and more elastic.
Add the noodles in to the soup, and top with your toppings of your choice.
The noodles turn soft rather quickly, so boil the noodles right before you eat.
For fresh pasta -



Place all ingredients in blender and blend on high speed until smooth.
Pour into glass with straw and enjoy!

Prepare a place for the paneer to drain, placing a colander in the sink and lining it with 4 thicknesses of cheesecloth or a clean linen kitchen towel.
Ina large (at least 3 quart) saucepan, bring the milk to a boil over high heat, stirring almost constantly to prevent it from burning or boiling over.
As soon as the milk comes to the boil, add the yogurt and sir gently.
The milk will soon foam up into soft clouds and then break into thick curds of cheese floating in a thin, faintly greenish liquid called whey.
Remove from the heat and pour the contents of the saucepan into the cheesecloth-lined colander placed in the sink to drain away the whey.
When the cloth is cool enough to handle, bring its corners together and squeeze the cheese into a ball, twisting the top portion of the cloth to force out more liquid and then securing it with a rubber band.
Suspend the cheese from the faucet and let it hang over the sink for about 30 minutes to drain off any remaining whey.
Now press the cheese to make it firm enough to cut.
To do this, place the wrapped lump of cheese on its side in a pie pan or frying pan, and place another pie pan or frying pan of equal or smaller size on top of it, or cover the cheese with a plate.
Balance a weighty object, such as a teapot filled with water, on the pan or plate to compress the cheese.
As you can see in the photos, I put the wrapped cheese in a bowl, placed a smaller bowl on top of that and a large, full bottle of wine into that bowl.
Press for 30 minutes more.
Carefully unwrap the pressed cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, transfer it to a container and seal tight.
Refrigerate until needed.
The paneer will keep 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator and several months in the freezer.

In a bowl, toss the beans with the vegetable oil and sugar.
Spread them in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet.
Roast them in the oven until crunchy and no longer soft in the centers, about 45 minutes.
(Stir them a few times to prevent burning.
).
Immediately toss the beans in a bowl with the cinnamon and salt.
Cool and serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

(If mixture gets too cold, it will be too stiff to beat properly.
).
Beat mixture with electric mixer just until soft peaks form when beaters are lifted.
(Cream will continue to thicken after a few minutes at room temperature, so be careful not to overbeat or it will turn curdy and grainy.
Should this happen, you can salvage it by remelting, rechilling, and rebeating.
).
To assemble, trim top of cakes with long serrated knife, cutting off any raised areas.
Place 1 cake layer on serving plate.
spread 1 cup chocolate cream evenly over layer.
Top with another cake layer and 1 more cup chocolate cream.

(I don't, but I would think you can spray the inside of the bread machine pan with Pam for easier release and clean-up).
Place ingredients in order into the bread machine.
Use dough cycle (mine's 1 1/2 hours).
Before cycle is done I lay out a piece of waxed paper with flour on it.
When cycle is done, "punch" dough.
Grease hands or spray with Pam as dough is very "sticky".
Remove dough from bread machine and place on floured surface/floured waxed paper.
Sprinkle a little flour on the top of the dough and "smooth" it over the top of the dough.
Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (I spray knife with Pam before cutting dough).
Place dough pieces evenly spaced apart on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.
Shape each piece of dough into an oval shape.
With kitchen scissors, make a "snip" in the center of each roll, about 1 to 2 inches long and about 1/4 inch deep.
Cover and let rise 20 minutes (I do this on the top of my stove as I have my oven preheated to 400 degrees already -- works well for me).
Bake at 400 degrees about 20 to 25 minutes.

Place into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, until done.
Allow to cool completely, break into large pieces and store in an airtight container.
*Note - granola nuggets form better if you stir the granola as little as possible while baking, and don't stir it at all while it's cooling.



Bring the butter, sugar and milk to a slow boil.
Add chocolate chips and stir until melted.
Use to frost brownies, chocolate cake-- whatever your little heart desires!



Cake:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Prepare a 10-cup bundt pan by spraying with cooking oil and lightly dusting with flour.
Cream sugar and butter.
Wisk together cornstarch and water and cream into sugar/butter mixture.
Stir in milk, orange juice and orange zest.
Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl and slowly add into wet mixture, stirring until thoroughly combined.
Fold cranberries into the batter.
Spoon batter evenly into bundt pan, being careful not to brush off too much of the flour dusting.
Bake for 45 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into cake comes out clean.
Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes and turn out onto a cake pedistal or plate.
Glaze:.
Place powdered sugar in a small bowl.
Stir in orange juice one tablespoon at a time until preferred glaze texture is obtained.
Spoon evenly over warm cake.
Garnish:.
I sprinkled slivered almonds evenly over the freshly-glazed cake.
I also placed cranberries into the center of the cake and around the base of the cake plate mostly for festive presentation, but found that my family enjoys eating the uncooked cranberries dipped in extra glaze or with bites of cake.



Combine water, soy sauce, cider vinegar, and sugar.
Add this to peanut butter, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.



Cook sausage in a skillet with 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter for about 5 minutes.
Add onions to sausage and cook until sausage is done.
Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, combine milk, Worcestershire sauce, and the black and cayenne pepper; set aside.
The amount of both kinds of pepper is subjective.
I like for my gravy to be spicy and hot so I put in what I think will be too much and then add two shakes.
It is almost always perfect for ME.
Do what is perfect for you.
When sausage/onion mixture is done, if you want to drain the extra grease, remove from the heat and do so.
I usually don't because unlike real sausage, the vegetarian sausage does not produce nearly as much, but it is enough.
Return sausage/onion mixture back to skillet.
Over medium/low heat, add the remaining butter (if necessary)
Gradually add the flour.
Turn to coat sausage and cook until golden (approx).
Return heat to medium.
Stir in small amounts of milk (about a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup at a time).Continue stirring and let it soak up the flour and get too thick and then add a little more.
Do this until it starts to thin and it takes on the consistency that you want.
Be sure that you are stirring more or less continuously and that your most recent addition is heated through.
(You may or may not use all of the milk mixture and if necessary, add more milk - Gravy is never an exact science)
Serve gravy over your favorite biscuits or bread.

To serve: gently stir the fruit; spoon into sherbet glasses.
TIP: Any combination of fruits may be used: fresh plums, kiwi, raspberries, pitted bing cherries, etc.
However, fresh peaches, fresh grapes, and fresh blueberries are a necessity.
Frozen or canned fruits are not recommended.

There is a certain amount of technique to successfully grilling cheese.
An essential is that the grill must be very hot.
To cook directly on the grill, first set the prepared cheese slices out at room temperature for a couple of hours.
As the surface dries out, a hard film starts to form.
This is what will keep you from ending up with a gooey puddle in the bottom of your grill.
If you don't quite feel up to cooking the cheese directly on the grill, you can use a pie plate or aluminum foil.
Cook about three minutes on each side.
Serve hot.

5 Easy Steps:.
1.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together warm water and honey until honey is dissolved.
Add yeast, and cover with a towel.
2.
In about 10-20 minutes, your mixture should look like the picture above.
(I would describe it as delightfully frothy.)
Mix in your salt, and then add the bread flour one cup at a time.
(I use the whisk for the first three cups and then switch to a wooden spoon or silicone spatula for the last three cups.
For the very last cup, I don't even stir.
).
(Take any rings off between Steps 2 and 3.
I learned this the hard way.
Keep them on the counter that is farthest away from the garbage disposal.
I also learned this the hard way.
).
3.
Add a little extra flour to your hands and knead the dough, about 5 minutes.
(Maybe this will get me in trouble with the baking police, but I knead the dough right in the large mixing bowl.
It keeps my counter cleaner.)
Place kneaded dough in a large, greased bowl and cover with towel.
4.
After an hour, your dough should have risen significantly.
(Here comes the best part!)
Punch the dough (Don't hold back!
Get out all your frustration!)
and then knead again for a couple of minutes.
Divide into two lightly-greased loaf pans and cover with your towel once more.
5.
After allowing the dough to rise for 30 minutes in the loaf pans, bake in a preheated oven at 325 for 30-35 minutes.
(For my oven, it's about 33 minutes.
A lot of bread recipes use an oven at 350.
I find 325 works better for honey.
).



.Mix the biga ingredients, cover and let rest for 1 hour at room temperature.
Then, refrigerate for 3 to 18 hours.
Mix the soaker, cover and rest for 4 to 19 hours.
To make the bread, warm the biga at room temperature or in low heat (<100F) until room temperature.
Spread the biga on a floured counter and layer the soaker over that.
Cut dough into 12 pieces and add to mixing bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients and mix and knead for 7 - 8 minutes.
Rest for 5 minutes and knead for 1 to 2 more minutes until a moderate windowpane is achieved.
Do a stretch and fold.
On a lightly floured counter, stretch the dough into a rectangle and fold it like a letter going into an envelope.
Turn 90 deg and fold again.
Invert and place in an oiled bowl or straight sided clear container.
Rest for 20 minutes and do another stretch and fold and return to container.
After the dough has risen to one and a half times it's original volume (30 to 45 more minutes), turn out onto a floured counter.

Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the yeast, flour, and salt and stir with a rubber spatula just until all the water is absorbed and a dry, clumpy dough forms.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 minutes, to allow the flour to absorb the water.
Use the dough hook of a stand mixer and mix the dough on low speed (2 on a KitchenAid mixer) for 8 to 10 minutes.
It will still be a little lumpy, although it will gather into a ball around the hook.
Pull it off the dough hook and knead it by hand for a few strokes on an unfloured surface until it is very smooth and springy.
(Alternatively, scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead with smooth, steady strokes until silky smooth and springy, 10 to 12 minutes.
Avoid kneading extra flour into the dough.)
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled, clear, 2-quart straight-sided container with a lid.
With masking tape, mark the spot on the container where the dough will be once it has increased 1 1/2 times in volume.
Cover and leave it to rise at room temperature (70 to 75 degrees) for 45 minutes.
It will increase by about 25 percent.
Lightly dust a work surface with flour and, using a bench scraper or spatula, empty the risen dough out of the container.
Pat it gently into a rectangle, about 6 x 8 inches, and fold it into thirds like a business letter.
With the short side facing you, lift the top edge and fold it into the center of the rectangle; lift the near edge and fold it into the center so that it overlaps the top edge by about 1-inch.
Quickly slide both hands under the dough and flip it over so the folds are underneath.
Slip it back into the container, pushing it down to fit.
Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm and draft-free spot until it expands, reaching halfway to the masking tape mark.
45 minutes to 1 hour.
About 1 hour before baking, place a baking stone on the middle rack of the oven and a cast-iron skillet on the lower rack.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
(If you are baking the breads on a baking sheet, its only necessary to preheat the oven about 20 minutes before baking.)
Lightly dust your work surface with flour.
Uncover the dough and turn it out onto the work surface.
With a bench scraper or chefs knife, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces.
Gently pat each piece into a rough rectangle and fold it in half.
Sprinkle the pieces of dough with flour and lightly drape them with plastic wrap.
Let them relax on the counter for 10 minutes.
Cover a bakers peel or rimless baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with flour.
Set aside.
On a lightly floured work surface, pat the dough into a rough rectangle measuring about 3 x 5 inches.
With the longer side facing you, fold the top of the dough down about one-third of the way toward the center.
With the heel of your hand, press along the seam using firm but gentle pressure.
Fold the bottom of the dough about one-third of the way toward the center and seal the seam firmly.
Fold this skinny rectangle in half, bringing the top edge down to meet the bottom edge.
Working from right to left, cup your hand over the log of dough arid press the heel of your hand down firmly to seal the seam.
Dust the work surface with additional flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
To stretch the log, place your hands together, palms down, over the middle of the log.
Using light, even pressure, roll the log back and forth as you spread your hands apart.
Repeat 3 or 4 times until the log is the desired length, about 14 inches long.
Leave the ends rounded.
Place the baguettes on the parchment, seam sides down, about 2 inches apart.
Lift the parchment between the loaves, making pleats and drawing the loaves together.
Tightly roll two kitchen towels and slip them under the parchment paper on the sides of the two outer loaves to support and cradle the baguettes.
Lightly dust the tops of the baguettes with flour and gently drape them with plastic wrap.
Let the loaves stand at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.
They will increase about 1 1/2 times in size.
Uncover the loaves, take away the towels, and stretch the parchment paper out so it is flat and the loaves are separated.
Score each baguette with a single-edge razor blade or a serrated knife.
Starting from the tip, angle the blade 45 degrees to make 3 slashes about 3 inches long and 1/2-inch deep.
Slide the loaves, still on the parchment, onto the hot baking stone or rimless baking sheet.
Place 1/2 cup of ice in the hot cast-iron skillet and slide back onto the lower rack to produce steam.
Bake the baguettes until caramel colored, 15 to 20 minutes.
Slide the peel or baking sheet under the parchment paper to remove the loaves from the oven.
Slide the loaves, still on the parchment, onto a wire rack to cool.
Eat them warm or at room temperature.

Put the ingredients in a bowl, pouring gradually as you stir.
Mix well so as not to leave lumps.
Once it's well combined, strain.
Transfer the mixture into a heatproof container (or empty milk carton) and cover with plastic wrap, but leave 1 cm or so from the sides unwrapped.
I just pour the mixture straight into a container while straining it in Step 2 since I like to cut corners.
Set the power to high and microwave for 7.5 minutes.
(500W) The time depends on the microwave, so check the mixture as it heats.
It will be a bit sticky at first, but it will set as it cools.
If you microwave it for too long it will turn hard, so be careful!!
I have done this before...
When the cake cools, cover with plastic wrap again and place in the fridge.
Remove from the container and cut into your desired sizes.
It's fun to take out from the container as it jiggles.



Lets get 'em first!
Go to the store and pick out the slab o'ribs you want!
Then, go back home.
Lets prep them!
I always pull off the skin on the back of the ribs and then score between the bones with a small paring knife.
In bowl mix together dry spices and herbs.
Mix and slap which slab all over the place with the stuff!
Make sure you get every nook and cranny!
While the rub is just a seaping in them juicy ribs, we are going to have some fun.
Find a patch of peppermint in the yard, or possibly your neighbors yard, or possibly go back to the store and get a good handful.
Clean it, take off the leaves and and put them in the blender.
Now, I have never measured this, but in Sicilian its called "MOGLIO", that means BETTER, but its the BEST!
!
You put with the pepperment leaves in the blender and add in: 2 peeled cloves of garlic1/2 c. of lemon juice1/8 c. of wine vinegar1/4 c. of extra virgin olive oil (or possibly vegetable oil)
healthy pinch of salt and pepper
Puree these ingredients together.
Place your ribs directly over the heat for 5 min making sure there is no fire.Then turn for 4 min.
Take ribs off heat and close or possibly put on the lid to BBQ pit.
They are going to cook slow and you can begin to put which mint, moglio, mix on the ribs after they have been cooking, and you have been turning occasionally, for about 45 min

Line a 13" x 9" pan with aluminum foil, butter the insides, and set aside.
Place chips, vanilla & butter flavor, about half the marshmallow creme, chilled butter, and nuts into a LARGE saucepan or Pyrex glass dish and set aside (or in the refrigerator).
Use Medium heat to bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or single stem hand mixer.
Add marshmallow creme - fold in - the boil will stop.
Bring back to a rolling boil and continue to boil for 8 full minutes by the clock (start timing once all the marshmallow has completely dissolved and the boil has resumed).
Use the lowest flame possible to keep the rolling boil.
The mixture will expand and start to turn brown during the boil.
If you get brown flakes in the mixture then turn down the heat a little and continue stirring.
Remove from heat and pour hot mixture over chips, vanilla, butter, butter flavor, and nuts without scraping the sides of the hot saucepan.
Mix thoroughly and pour into prepared pan.
Cool 2-3 hours at room temperature.
Remove from pan, remove foil, cut into squares.
Store in an airtight container with wax paper dividers for up to 2 weeks.
Makes about 4 pounds of fudge.
NOTES:.
* THE STUFF GROWS: After adding the Marshmallow Creme and butter to the hot milk/sugar solution, the volume will expand to almost twice the original volume.
So use a sufficiently large sauce pan (4 quart or better).
As the boil continues, the volume will begin to contract.
Stirring is important to help distribute the heat throughout the mixture and prevent scorching.
Remember, this recipe calls for two [2] sauce pans -- one to boil and one to mix.
* YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE: If you don't have access to milk chocolate chips then you may use 24 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips - though it has a stronger chocolate taste.
Two large Hershey bars (7 ounces each) will more than substitute for the milk chocolate chips.
You can also use 24 ounces of white Chips for an excellent Vanilla Fudge.
Don't be shy about substituting mini-marshmallows for the Marshmallow Creme.
* MAKE HALF A BATCH: You may cut the recipe in half (using exactly 1/2 the amount of everything) but the boil time must be reduced to [5] full minutes by the clock.
I would also recommend a 9" x 9" pan.
You can also substitute 5 ounces of evaporated milk (one small can) for 6 ounce (half a large can).
* PERSEVERE: This is a much more liquid mix (more 'soupy') than other fudge recipes and you might get discouraged midway.
Keep going.
I've nearly given up several times only to have it set extremely well once cast.
* NERVOUS NELLY: If you're afraid this won't set (and it will) or if you just want a more firm fudge then bring the milk and sugar to a rolling boil for a full minute before adding the marshmallow.
During the second boil (after the marshmallows are dissolved) go for 9 or 10 minutes.
This will set very quickly and be a much firmer fudge.
* DON'T PANIC: If you use a candy thermometer (and this recipes *does not call for a candy thermometer*) the temperature will not reach the normal 232-236F found in other fudge recipes.
It will attain something around 220-224F Don't panic!
This is a whole different way of making fudge.
The mixture will set once cast.
* STORAGE: Fudge will keep for up to two weeks at room temperature.
You'll need to store it wrapped in waxed paper (cut it up into reasonable segments) and in an airtight container.
Fudge will keep frozen for up to six months.
When freezing fudge you'll need to wrap in waxed paper, store in a double-airtight container.
I use double freezer Baggies.
Thaw fudge at room temperature in its air-tight container -- it will take most of one day.
* SOFTNESS: This produces a medium-hard fudge.
If you prefer a softer fudge (or if the weather is especially dry on the day you make the fudge -- like snowing or you live in the desert) then boil for only [7] minutes instead of the recommended [8] minutes.
Conversely, if you'd like a firmer fudge (or if the weather is especially damp on the day you make fudge) then boil for [9] minutes instead of the recommended [8] minutes.

Mix dry ingredients and sift into mixing bowl, then cut in lard or crisco until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Stir in buttermilk until it is incorporated with the flour mixture.
The dough will be kind of wet and very sticky.
Flour your hands and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
Roll the dough in the flour just enough to make it handleable - you don't want it to stick to your hands too much, but don't work in too much extra flour either or the biscuits will be heavy and taste of raw flour.
For each biscuit, pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a large egg or a small lemon and pat out in the ungreased pan with your hands.
You don't want it to be really flat, just pat it down a bit so it's relatively biscuit-shaped and about 1 inch high.
Bake at 475 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the tops are golden brown.
Keep your eye on them while they're in the oven so they don't burn.
Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter, if desired.

Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 1 hour.
Dough should increase 1.5-2 times.
Deflate dough and turn on to floured surface.
Pat dough flat into a rectangular shape and fold into three sections as you would a letter.
Repeat 2 times.
Return to bowl, smooth side up and cover with plastic.
Allow to rise for at least 1-1.5 hours.
Dough should increase 2.5-3 times.
Cut dough into two equal parts and shape each into a round loaf making sure that you create sufficient surface tension on the top of the loaf.
Gather the dough at the bottom as you shape the loaf, pinching the dough together on the bottom and forming a seal.
Place both loaves bottom side up on a floured linen towel and cover with another floured linen towel.
Allow to rise for an additional 1-1.5 hours.

1.Choose a squash with a thick neck and a short belly, as all the meat is in the neck.
Split and seed it.
Put it a glass pan with 1/4 inch of water, double cover it with saran, and microwave it fro 20 min, till it is tender.
You can put in a covered pan with water in a 400 F oven and it will steam in about the same time or possibly a little longer.
When it is fork tender it is done.
2.Drain it and let it cold, and when you can handle it, the tan skin will scrape off with little trouble.
Much easier than using a potato peeler when raw (that certainly works).
3.Mash it with butter season it with salt and cinnamon to taste, and put it into a buttered oven dish.
A dash of dark rum contributes interest to the mix.
Babancourt Haitian is what I use.
4.Drizzle the remaining butter over it, and sprinkle the top with brown sugar, using more or possibly less to taste.
You can also use Maple Syrup instead of brown sugar.
You can also omit the sugar, or possibly just put a little in with the mashed squash.
5.Bake at 350 F for about 30 min till a crust forms from the melted sugar.

You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional), unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a rolling pin.
Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water over, and stir or possibly process briefly to mix.
Let stand for thirty min.
When you come back to the bulgur mix, it will look like the bulgur has totally absorbed the water.
However, proceed by adding 1 c. flour and the chopped onion, and process for 1 minute.
The dough should come together into a large ball as you process.
If it doesn't, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the processor, add in 2 Tbsp.
hot water and process for 30 seconds; again if the bulgur and flour still do not come together, add in another 2 Tbsp.
water and process.
Once a ball of dough forms, process for 2 to 3 min longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface.
(If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with half at a time, adding 1/2 c. flour to each portion, then combine when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand).
Knead by hand for 4 to 5 min.
Alternatively, if you don't have a food processor, combine bulgur, salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30 min.
Add in onions and 1/2 c. flour and stir in.
Add in another 1/2 c. flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough.
With a little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat sticky) which you can knead.
Turn out onto a well-floured kneading surface and knead for 6 or possibly 7 min.
Dough will be sticky at first, but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is.
When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand till you are ready to proceed further, for 15 min to an hour, whatever is convenient.
To bake, have your oven preheated to 450F with baking stone or possibly quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven.
Divide the dough into 8 pcs, and flatten each on a well-floured bread board.
With a rolling pin, roll out one or possibly two breads till very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter.
Work with only one or possibly two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven.
When ready, handle the bread gently as you place it on the warm tiles.
(You can also try dusting a peel or possibly the back of a baking sheet with flour and using peel or possibly sheet to transfer breads to warm tiles.)
Bake on one side for 1 1/2 to 2 min then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2 min.
The bread should begin to brown around the outside.
When baked, keep breads hot by stacking them one on top of the other and wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel.
Serve hot.
Yield: 8 thin, supple and slightly chewy flatbreads between 8 and 10 inches in diameter.
NOTES : The dough for this cracker-like unyeasted flatbread is easily mixed in the food processor.
The breads have a wonderful aroma as they bake and a satisfying savory taste, for the dough is made of full-grain bulgur, with only a little flour, and flavored with chopped onion.
The breads bake quickly in the oven.
Bulgur breads go wonderfully with cheese, or possibly strong flavors.
Leave them to dry out and use as crackers, or possibly wrap in a cloth to keep chewy and supple.

When you use this flour with baking powder and baking soda recipes, you need to know the following things:
1.
You need xanthan gum to give a lighter, spongier texture (acts like gluten in wheat flour), approximately 1/4 teaspoon per cup.
2.
This flour might take a bit more liquid than normal flour as the coconut flour is very absorbent.
3.
To get a lighter, fluffier texture, I suggest beating your egg whites separately from the yolks.
This makes a world of difference.
The recipe can be halved and even quartered if you do not feed a large crew like I do.



Preheat the oven to 400F and lightly oil an ovenproof pan large enough to accommodate all of the fillets in a single layer.
Stir the lemon juice and salt together, then coat the halibut in the mixture and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Pat the fillets dry with paper towels and place them in the prepared pan.
Brush each fillet with 1/4 teaspoon of the olive oil and top with 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the fish is opaque and flakes easily.
To be certain the fish is done, push a two-pronged kitchen fork straight down into the flesh.
If you feel no resistance, the fish is cooked; if not, return the fish to the oven for another minute or two.
Top each fillet with 1 tablespoon of the relish before serving.
For a totally different taste sensation, marinate the halibut in Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette (page 181) for 30 minutes.
Pat the fillets dry with paper towels.

Nutritionists tout fish as a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which studies suggest may be beneficial for people fighting breast and prostate cancer.
But recent research suggests that not all fish are created equal, and what people really should be looking at is the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6, as omega-6s may promote cancer growth.
This ratio could be at the heart of the benefits of the so-called Mediterranean diet, which some researchers believe is linked to lower cancer rates in Mediterranean countries.
The magic ratio of omega-3s to omega-6s appears to be no less than 1 to 1 (and preferably a lot more omega 3s).
For example, halibuts ratio is 2.5 to 1 (good), wild king salmon comes in at 5.6 to 1 (better), and fish roe weighs in at 11.1 to 1 (a slam dunk).
By contrast, farm-raised catfish has fifty times more omega-6s than omega-3s.
A good rule of thumb is to look for wild fish, as opposed to farm-raised, since the feed given to some cultivated fish can be high in omega-6s.

1.
If you like, use vegetable, beef, or possibly chicken stock or possibly bouillon to replace all or possibly part of water.
2.
Pick over the grain, removing any gravel or possibly discolored bits.
Rinse and drain.
Place the grain, liquid, oil, salt if using, and any selected seasonings in the pressure cooker.
I have selected pearled barley, but any grain except bulgar or possibly buckwheat groats (kasha), that turn to mush too easily, may be used.
3.
Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
Adjust the heat to maintain high pressure, and cook for the recommended amount of time (18-20 min for pearled barley).
Quick-release the pressure under cool running water.
Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.
4.
If the grains are still very chewy, lock the lid back in place and return to high pressure for a few more min; if slightly underdone, replace the lid and cook over low heat for a few more min.
When done, drain off any excess liquid and reserve it, if you like.
For drier fluffier grains, immediately return the cooked grains to the pot and replace the lid, allowing them to steam in the residual heat for a few min.

Stir the yeast into the warm water to dissolve.
Add the flour.
Stir the remaining ingredients into the flour mixture.
Knead with dough hook or by hand until smooth and elastic (approx 5 minutes).
Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover.
Allow to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Punch down the dough and divide into portions.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into very thin rounds and top as desired.
Bake at 400F until crisp and golden brown, approx 8-12 minutes.
NOTE: Unrolled dough may be wrapped and stored in the fridge for 2 days.
Rolled dough may be stored in the freezer; I have kept rolled dough in the freezer for several months with the only effect being a less puffy baked crust.



Poke the ribs with a fork a few times.
Marinate ribs in dressing.
Place in crock pot and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours.

In a saucepan over medium heat, mix together the corn syrup, sugar, peanut butter and vanilla.
Bring to a boil stirring constantly.
Once it has reached a boil, cook for one minute.
Take off heat and pour over popped corn, working fast, stir in all of the peanut butter coating, mixing well so that all of the popcorn is evenly coated.
Let popcorn sit for about 10 minutes and then mix again to break up the pieces.
In a bowl, melt the chocolate for 20 seconds at a time in the microwave, stirring in between each 20 second cooking, until the chocolate is melted through.
Be sure not to burn the chocolate.
Once the chocolate is melted, drizzle the chocolate over the popcorn either with a spoon or by spooning the chocolate into a small Ziploc bag and then cutting a small hole at one of the tips and then drizzling over by squeezing the bag over the popcorn.
Let set for 30 minutes and then break up the popcorn!
If the chocolate isnt setting you can put your cookie sheets or roasting pan into the fridge for 15 minutes and then you should be good to go!
Enjoy!



In a medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder.
Stir in milk and oil just until blended.
Add the nuts.
Spread in an ungreased 9x13 baking pan.
Mix the second portion of cocoa powder with the brown sugar until combined.
Spread evenly over the batter in the pan.
Then pour the hot water over everything.
(You may want to place the 9x13 pan on a baking sheet to catch any drips that may bubble out of the pan.
If you use a Pyrex dish you will definitely want to do this.)
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
It will look something like a chocolate cobbler, with a cake portion that should be dry and set on top with the chocolate sauce bubbling through cracks and around the edges.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
I find this is also good served with caramel sauce or fresh berries.



Combine ingredients and mix.
I suggest adding everything but the cream shake it them pour and stir in the cream.
I have accidentally made whipped cream before :).
Note on sweetener; I typically use truvia but you can use whatever you are using a very small amount so the carbs in the real sugar are negligible.
You can drink this right away but a good 24 hours in the fridge definitely improves the flavor and consistency.
It lasts about a week and a half when I make a liter of it.



Mix together the yeast, sugar, and water, allow to sit for 30-45 minutes.
Once the water is good and bubbly (if you don't see bubbles, throw it out and try new yeast), mix the bread flour together.
Do not shape, just mix it together until everything looks wet.
Allow to sit for another 30 minutes.
Do not add more flour, and do not add the salt yet (you will do this later).
Coat your hands with flour and knead the dough for 10-15 minutes (or in a bread machine/mixer for 5 minutes).
Adjust the amount of flour/water only after kneading if necessary, the act of kneading tends to add a lot of extra flour, and you want a wet-ish dough.
Let the dough rise, covered, a minimum of 6 hours and maximum of 3 days (I've actually gone over 7 days, but the dough gets a bit crusty after a while).
If resting the dough for more than 10 hours put it in the fridge.
The longer you let the dough sit the better the flavor will be.
After the rise, gently deflate any large holes in the dough (you don't literally need to "punch it down"), and form a ball with the dough.
Pat the dough out to a rectangle.
Stretching the dough, fold it over to make a square, and sprinkle with salt.
Fold the dough again, sprinkle again.
Keep folding and sprinkling until you have added the 1 tsp (three folds tends to do it for me).
Knead the entire ball once or twice just to make sure the salt is evenly distributed.
Shape the dough as desired, I tend to split the dough into two at this point and make two baguettes.
Allow to rise until each is doubled, about an hour.
The dough is done rising when an indentation made with your finger does not spring back.
Slash (or cut) the top of the baguettes immediately before placing them in the oven.
Bake in a pre-heated 425 oven on a baking stone (if possible) for approximately 25 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom.
Spray the oven with water immediately after putting the bread in the oven, and again at 10 and 20 minutes.
After removing the bread from the oven, listen carefully for the crust to crackle.
If you hear that, grin like a madman and be very proud of yourself -- but do not touch the bread for at least 1/2 hours It's painful to wait, but well worth it!
Note: Due to the ingredients, this bread is best enjoyed the same day as baked, and will only keep for 2-3 days at most.



In a 2-quart saucepan, stir together the sugar, cornstarch, nutmeg and cinnamon.
Mix in the water and juice.
Bring this to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.
Reduce heat and simmer for one minute.
Stir in the peaches and continue simmering for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until peaches soften slightly.
Remove from heat.
Because the peaches will continue to cook in the hot syrup, you don't want to overcook them while pan is on the heat.
Serve warm or cold over ice cream.



Preheat oven to 250F Position rack in the middle of the oven.
In a bowl toss the peanuts with the lime juice until moistened.
Sprinkle with the chili powder and toss until coated.
Spread the peanuts in one layer on a flat baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes or until a light crust if formed.
Careful not to burn!
Remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with salt.
Meanwhile place the pumpkinseeds in a large skillet over medium heat.
When the first one pops, stir constantly until all the kernals have popped from flat to round.
Combine the pumpkinseeds with the peanuts, raisins and chopped apricots.
Store in an airtight container for up to a week.



Preheat the oven to 450F(230C).
With a pastry brush, use the 2 tablespoons melted butter to thoroughly butter the financier molds.
Arrange them side by side, but not touching, on a baking sheet.
Place the baking sheet with the buttered molds in the freezer to resolidify the butter and make the financiers easier to unmold.
In a large bowl, combine the almonds, sugar, flour, and salt.
Mix to blend.
Add the egg whites and mix until thoroughly blended.
Add the 3/4 cup butter and mix until thoroughly blended.
The mixture will be fairly thin and pourable.
Spoon the batter into the molds, filling them almost to the rim.
Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven.
Bake until the financiers just being to rise, about 7 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 400F(205C).
Bake until the financiers are a light, delicate brown and begin to firm up, about another 7 minutes.
Turn off the oven heat and let the financiers rest in the oven until firm, about another 7 minutes.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the financiers cool in the molds for 10 minutes.
Unmold.
(Note: Wash molds immediately with a stiff brush in hot water without detergent so that they retain their seasoning.)
The financiers may be stored in an airtight container for several days.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, salt, baking soda and nutmeg.
Cream together the butter and sugar.

Spread pecans on ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown, stirring twice.
Spread pecans on foil to cool.
Store in airtight container.



Combine the flour, yeast, butter and salt in a large bowl.
Mix well, then gradually pour in the cold water, mixing until the dough begins to come together.
The dough should be moist but firm enough that you can knead with your hands.
Turn out the dough onto a well floured surface and knead for 15 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Form into a ball and return the bowl.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let the dough rest for 30-45 minutes.
Remove from bowl to a floured working surface and divide into 8 equal sized pieces.
Form each into a small round roll.
To form into rolls, repeatedly fold over the outer edges of the ball into towards the center of the ball, gently pressing down.
Once the bottom side is round and smooth, turn it over so the smooth side is on top.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and evenly arrange the rolls.
Lightly cover with a clean tea towel or baking cloth.
Let rest in the refrigerator 8 hours.
This helps the outer skin of the dough slightly dry out so it doesn't lose shape when boiling.
After 8 hours when you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 210C/410F.
While the oven is preheating, prepare the baking soda bath to boil pretzels: Bring 1 liter/1 quart of water to a boil and add 5 teaspoons of baking soda (the ratio of water to baking soda is important!
It's what gives the pretzels their distinct color and flavor).
Plop the pretzel rolls into the water 1 or 2 at a time.
You don't want to crowd them.
Boil for 30 seconds on one side then flip over and boil for another 30-45 seconds.
Remove the boiled pretzels from the pot with a slotted spoon and place on a rack to drain for a couple minutes.
While the pretzels are still wet, cut a shallow "X" shape across the top of each rolls and sprinkle with coarse salt, poppy seeds and/or sesame seeds.
When done, remove onto a rack and let cool for a few minutes.
Serve with plenty of butter!
Arrange the rolls on a baking sheet that has been lightly greased or covered with parchment paper.
Bake in the oven at 210C/410F.
for 18-20 minutes, or until they pretzels turn a deep, golden brown color.



In small bowl combine all ingredients.
Stir to combine.
Store in an airtight container.



Combine the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter to coat the pieces with the flour.
The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.
Next add the heavy cream.
Fold everything together, being careful not to overwork the dough.
Fold in the dried cranberries.
Form large mounds out of the dough.
The size can vary depending on if you want to stretch the recipe to make more.
(I generally make them bigger than a golf ball, but smaller than a tennis ball.)
Arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in a 400-degree oven for 16-20 minutes, or until the top just barely turns golden brown.



Mix cold water and cornstarch in a pint-sized spray bottle that releases a fine mist.
To use, shake well, spray and iron immedietly.

Using electric mixer, beat vanilla & cream in bowl until cream just holds stiff peaks.
Fold chocolate mixture into whipped cream, leaving a few streaks.
Spoon into dessert cups or goblets and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.



Preheat the oven to 325F.
Place the margarine, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl and stir vigorously until smooth and creamy.
Add the flour, cinnamon, and baking soda and stir until thoroughly combined.
Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of the dough about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned on the edges.
Baking soda and baking powder are both leavening agents, which means they cause baked goods to rise, but theyre used in different situations.
To be effective, baking soda must be combined with acidic ingredients.
This causes carbon dioxide bubbles to form, which raises the dough.
Baking powder contains everything it needs to raise dough when combined with liquid ingredients, so it can be used in recipes that dont include acidic ingredients.
And sometimes both are used.



In a food processor, combine mayonnaise, chutney, curry powder, and lime juice; season with the coarse salt and a pinch of ground pepper.

Melt 8 ounces of chocolate.
Heat the butter and cream until the butter is melted and small bubbles form.
Pour into a small bowl and stir in the chocolate.
Whisk in the jam and lemon juice.
cover and refrigerate 60-90 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with parchment.
Spoon the mixture into mounds (about 2 teaspoons each).
Refrigerate 15 minutes or until firm.
Use the cornstarch to dust your hands, and roll the mixture into balls.
Refrigerate overnight.
Remove centers from the refrigerator to warm to room temperature before the next steps.
Melt 1 1/2 pounds of chopped chocolate and temper as follows.
If the chocolate is dull, grainy, or blemished, heat to at least 115 degrees.
When the chocolate is nearly melted, stir to complete the melt.
Let the chocolate cool to 100 degrees.
Look at the chunk of solid chocolate- it should be smooth, dark, and glossy, without dullness or streaking.
Submerge the 6 ounces of solid chocolate in the melted chocolate and stir until the chocolate cools to 90 degrees.
What this process does is isomerize the chocolate as it cools, so that the cooled shells will stay glossy and smooth, even in the refrigerator.
If the solid chunk is dull, streaky, or grained, it will have the opposite effect.
The taste will be the same, but tempering the chocolate makes the truffles much more attractive.
When the chocolate has cooled to 90 degrees, remove the chunk and save it for the next time you temper chocolate.
Smear a thin sample of the melted chocolate on wax paper and refrigerate for 2 minutes.
The smear should cool glossy and smooth, and should break with a snap.
Dip each truffle in chocolate; two forks seem to work the best for this (although I'd be interested in hearing anyone else's idea).
Top the truffles with cocoa or nuts if desired; if you plan to do this, do each truffle as you dip them, because they solidify fairly quickly.
Refrigerate until set.

In spite of the potential danger of lowering an unwieldy turkey into a small vat of boiling oil, fans of Cajun Deep-Fried Turkey say it's worth the risk because the turkey comes out moist and juicy, and deep-frying cuts hrs off the cooking time.
It is definitely an outdoor activity.
Most experts insist which the turkey weigh no more than 12 pounds.
The turkeys are injected with a spicy marinade, then plunged into a pot of boiling oil and deep-fried.
Following are tips to help you safely deep-fry a turkey.
=B7 Handle turkey, pots and oil carefully.
=B7 Use water to measure the capacity of your deep-fryer, if you are unsure how much oil will be needed.
=B7 Hook a heavy wire coat hanger to the wire band which secures the turkey legs to help when lowering and lifting the turkey from the fryer.
Use a sturdy cooking spoon, tongs or possibly a large fork for extra support; do not depend on the wire band alone, as it can loosen during frying.
Before removing the pot from the burner, let the oil cold 1 hour after the turkey has been removed and the burner is turned off.
Before you begin to fry, you need to season the turkey.
You can inject strained bottled Italian salad dressing for the marinade or possibly use the Cajun Injector, a kit which includes a 16-oz jar of marinade and a syringe-type injector.
The kit is available at many supermarkets and specialty food shops.
Use about 1 oz of marinade per lb.
of turkey (it's better to buy a fresh turkey than the pre-basted type because pre-basted turkeys are saltier, said Reece Williams, who helped develop the Injector).
Marinades can be injected into a whole turkey in about 5 min.
Remove the giblets from the turkey cavities, wash cavities and pat dry.
Inject the marinade into the turkey thighs, legs and breast.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees in a 40-qt cooker (such as a propane or possibly butane cooker with a steamer basket and cover).
Sprinkle Cajun seasonings over the entire bird and inside the cavity.
Carefully lower the turkey into the oil and deep-fry 3 1/2 min per lb., maintaining oil at 350 degrees.
Remove the turkey carefully and let oil cold.
Makes 12 to 15 servings.

Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium heat.
When hot, stir in the sugar and whisk until dissolved.
Once the milk is hot and steaming, add the chocolate and salt and turn the heat down to medium low.
Stir until the chocolate is completely melted.
The hot chocolate is now ready to serve.
If you prefer a thicker consistency (like me), keeping whisking and cook at a low boil for 3-5 minutes until it becomes thick and creamy.
Dont walk away, stay with it and lightly whisk to prevent scorching.
Serve warm with homemade marshmallows if desired.
Makes 4-6 small servings in demitasse or coffee cups.
Add-ins: You can also serve this with a small jigger of peppermint Kahlua or creme de mente.
Your guests add it to the chocolate as desired.
(Adapted from a recipe by David Lebovitz.)

Preheat your oven to 400'F.
Place the flour, baking powder and the salt into a bowl.
Make a well in the center and add the water and oil.
Combine by gradually incorporating the flour into the olive oil and water.
You may want to add a little more water if necessary.
Transfer the dough to a floured board and knead it at least for 5-7 minutes.
Let the dough rest in an air tight plastic bag while you prepare the toppings for your pizza.
Once the toppings are made, set them aside and take the dough out of the plastic bag.
Put a tiny bit of oil in the center of your pizza pan and with your hands and finger tips spread the dough to cover the pan.
I use a 12 inch pizza pan.
You could probably stretch it to 15 inches, but it would be a thinner crust.
Place your pizza sauce on the dough and then cover with your favorite toppings.
Pop it into the preheated oven.
Check it after about 20 minutes to see how the crust is browning.
Some ovens are hotter then others, so this is a good habit to get into.

After dipping 4 truffles, sprinkle a pinch of the remaining ground hazelnuts on top of them, before the chocolate sets up.
Let the truffles set up at room temperature, or chill them in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.
When the truffles are set, place them in paper candy cups.
In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the truffles will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer.
The truffles are best served at room temperature.
Instead of dipping the truffles in tempered chocolate, roll them in a small bowl of cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, or finely chopped, toasted hazelnuts as soon as they are rolled into balls.
Any nuts can be substituted for the hazelnuts both inside and outside the truffles.
White Chocolate Hazelnut Truffles: Substitute white chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate and use 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream.
Milk Chocolate Hazelnut Truffles: Substitute milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate and use 1 cup heavy whipping cream.
Milk Chocolate Almond Truffles: Substitute milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate, use 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and substitute finely chopped almonds for the hazelnuts.

Place 2 cups of the flour into a bowl or the bucket of a dough mixer.
Pour the boiling water over the flour, and stir till smooth.
Cover the bowl or bucket and set the mixture aside for 30 minutes.
In a seperate bowl, whisk together the potato flour (or flakes or buds) and the remaining 1 cup of flour with the salt, oil and yeast.
Add this to the cooled flour/water mixture, stir, then knead for several minutes (by hand, or mixer) to form a soft dough.
Continue mixing for 5 minutes.
The dough should form a ball, but will remain somewhat sticky.
Add additional flour only if necessary; if kneading by hand, keep your hands and work surface lightly oiled.
Let the dough rise, covered, for 1 hour.
Divide the dough into 8 pieces (each about the size of a handball, cover, and let rest for 15-30 minutes.
Roll each piece into a 7"-8"-circle, and dry-fry them (fry without oil) over medium heat for about 1 minute per side, until they're puffed and flecked with brown spots.
Adjust the heat if they seem to be cooking either too quickly, or too slowly; cooking too quickly means they may be raw in the center, while too slowly will dry them out.
Transfer the cooked breads to a wire rack, stacking them to keep them soft.
Serve immediately, or cool slightly before storing in a plastic bag.



Cream peanut butter and margarine, add sugars and mix well.

Cool on cookie sheets for about 5 minutes then transfer onto newspaper- the newspaper soaks up extra grease so the cookies don't become crumbly, little trick I learned from my MIL- this is also optional.
Immediately after the cookies are completely cooled I always transfer them to an airtight container.
These cookies have always stayed soft and moist if they are stored in an airtight container.

Pour the sugar powder into the strainer and sift it into the bowl, pressing against the powder with the back of a spoon to force it through the mesh.
Return any larger bits left in the strainer to the grinder and process into a fine powder.
Sift again and repeat with the grinding and sifting as needed until all of the sugar mixture is processed (you may have a few solids left to be discarded).
Place a sheet of paper on a work surface.
Have about 20 (8-inch) paper straws and a toothpick ready.

Fill a deep, wide-mouthed bowl with the cream and the milk.
Leave the mixture in the refrigerator for several hours (preferably overnight).
Heat the oven to 180 degrees F.
Boil several cups of water and pour it into a pan large enough to accomodate the bowl of milk.
Place the pan into the pre-heated oven.
Set the bowl of milk into the pan of water in the oven and leave until the top of the milk is crusted with a nubbly yellowish-cream surface.
(This will take at least 1 1/2 hours, but it is prudent to allow longer since this process varies depending on the fat content of the milk and cream).
Once the surface is nicely crusted, remove the bowl from the pan and cool it rapidly in a bowl of ice water.
Place the cooled bowl in the refrigerator until very cold.
Remove the crust from the cream with a skimmer or a large slotted spoon and put it into another bowl with a bit of the creamy liquid underneath; as the clotted cream firms up you will need to stir in the liquid to achieve a nice consistency.
Put the milk bowl back into the pan of water in the oven for a second crust to form, and add that in its turn to the first one.
Note: The left over milk is great to make rice pudding, or can be used in baking.

5.
Mix the baking soda and baking powder, then stir into the yogurt in another bowl.
When mixed, add it to the farina mixture and blend together.
6.
Grease the baking pan with a little shortening and pour the batter inches (As an option, you can drizzle the top with 2 tablespoons of yogurt.
).
7.
Using a knife, score the top of the batter into medium-sized rectangles -- or to be a bit fancier, try diamond shapes!
(You'll probably make 12-16 pieces.)
Place a blanched almond in the middle of each piece.
8.
Using your oven mitts, put the pan into the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until it's brown on top.
9.

Turn off the heat and add the apples in layers; about halfway through, dot with some of the remaining butter and sugar.
Use the rest of the butter and sugar on top of the last layer, along with the cinnamon if you like.
Put in the oven.
Bake, undisturbed, until the apples give up their liquid and it evaporates and the sides of the mass are dark brown and sticky looking.
This will take around 45 minutes, but it could be considerably longer or shorter depending on the water content of your apples.
Remove and let cool.
Serve straight from the pan orfor a more attractive presentationinvert onto a plate.
Great with ice cream: Melt 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter in the pan; add the apples and sugar, only 1/2 to 3/4 cup in this instance, depending on the sweetness of your apples; add the cinnamon at this point too.

Mix until the dough comes together and pulls cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.
Remove the dough from the bowl; flatten it into a disk.
wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to use.
For crostata: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Toss together the berries, sugar and cornstarch in a medium bowl; stir gently until well coated.
Set aside.
Roll the crostata dough out on a lightly floured surface to a roughly 16-inch diameter circle.
Leave it a little thick; the added texture is better.
Transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.
Place the fruit mixture in the center.
Distribute fruit in a low mound, leaving a 2-inch border.
Fold the edges of the dough over the fruit to form a 6-sided tart, with the fruit showing in the center.
Fold one edge over, then fold the second edge over, pleating the dough as necessary and pressing firmly on the pleat.
Lightly brush the dough with a little water; sprinkle with coarse sugar.
Bake until the crust is brown and the fruit is soft and thickened, 30 to 35 minutes.

Place the yeast and warm water into a medium size bowl and stir to dissolve the yeast.
Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hand for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth, and dough is elastic.
The starter will be thick and stretchy.
It will become more elastic after it has risen.
Scrape the starter into a clear container with high sides, and cover with plastic wrap.
Mark the height of the starter and the time on a piece of tape on the side of the container so you can see how much it rises.
At this point, you have two options.
If you plan on making the dough the same day, let the sponge rise at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to indent on top.
This may take 6 to 8 hours.
It will triple in volume, and very small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top of the surface as it reaches its peak and begins to deflate.
Use it before it sinks too much.
If you plan to make the dough the following day, let the sponge rise for 1 hour after mixing, then place it in the refrigerator and let it rise for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use.
Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough.
Let it sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature.
This may take several hours.

Two main factors have long affected the historic course of Irish bread making.
The first is related to the climate, in which this land is greatly influenced by the gulf Stream to the extent which it is neither warm in the summer nor cool in the winter.
Hence, the forty shades of green and the fact which traditional hard wheats utilized in bread baking don't grow well.
At least in the last millennium, Ireland has been relatively plentiful in fuel for baking.
Various medieval overlords of Ireland were never able to exercise tight control over the forest land so firewood could be freely poached.
As a result, anyone with a hearthstone could afford to bake on a small scale.
In Ireland plain soda bread is as likely to be served as a accompaniment to a main meal in order to soak up the gravy as it's likely to appear with the breakfast in a fry.
Soda bread comes in white or possibly brown varieties and is served as a cake or possibly a farl, based on regional differences.
We'll being including all the various Soda Bread variations during our All-Irish Cooking month at Recipe-a-Day!
Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to make sure the bicarbonate of soda is proportionately distributed.
Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the buttermilk into the center and start stirring.
Continue to mix till you achieve a dough which is raggy and very soft.
Add in more buttermilk sparingly is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly impact the mix.
Blend quickly, but not too energetically till the whole mass of dough has become a floury, raggy consistency.
Turn the contents of the bowl out onto a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread.
Your primary concern is speed in kneading.
The chemical reaction of the bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet.
You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running high, so do not over knead.
Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in diameter.
Place the dough on a baking sheet which has been lightly dusted with flour and use a sharp knife to cut across the circle making sure the cut goes about halfway down through the sides of the circle of dough so which it will flower properly.
Bake for about 10-min in a 350-F to 400-F Degree pre-heated oven, then decrease the heat and continue to bake another 30 to 35-min till you can tap the loaf and a hallowish sound is produced.
For a crunchy crust place the cooked cake on the rack to cold.
For a softer crust, wrap the cake in a clean dishcloth and store as soon as it"s out of the oven.
Either way, the soda bread is wonderful sliced or possibly split and served warm with sweet butter and the jelly or possibly jam of your choice.

Chop the chocolate: Use a chef's knife to chop the chocolate as finely as possible; this will help it melt quickly and evenly.
Then place it in a medium glass bowl.
(Glass retains heat, so the chocolate will stay melted longer.)
Make the ganache: Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles form around the edge.
Remove from the heat and add about one-fourth of the chocolate; whisk until smooth.
Slowly pour the cream mixture over the remaining chocolate in the bowl and let sit until the chocolate melts, about 30 seconds.
Puree the melted chocolate with an immersion blender or beat with a whisk until all the lumps disappear and the ganache is smooth.
Stir in the butter until smooth, then add liqueur, if desired.
(Jacques adds the liqueur last, so the flavor doesn't cook off.)
Pour and set: Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-foot overhang on one side.
Pour the ganache onto the baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula.
Fold the plastic wrap back over and press directly onto the surface of the ganache.
Let cool at room temperature at least 4 hours or overnight.
For the truffles: Using two teaspoons, scoop small mounds of the ganache onto parchment-lined baking sheets.
Set aside until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes in the refrigerator or 2 hours at room temperature.
Roll into balls: Place the chocolate mounds between both palms, squeeze slightly and roll.
Refrigerate until ready to coat.
Temper the chocolate: This is a gentle melting and cooling process that gives chocolate a glossy finish.
For the coating, place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until melted, about 40 minutes.
Pour into a clean glass bowl; stir to cool to between 88 degrees and 90 degrees, about 40 minutes.
(Jacques recommends a laser thermometer for checking the temperature.)
Dip and coat: Spread out the cocoa powder, coconut and nuts on parchment paper.
One at a time, dip each truffle in the tempered chocolate with a two-prong dipping fork (you can buy one at a baking-supply store or break off the middle tines of a plastic fork).
Lift the truffle and let the excess chocolate drip off.
Roll in toppings and place on a rack to dry.
Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

I prefer it with some of the bean skins intact.
Outside Japan, you can find cheap glutinous rice flour imported from Thailand (not to be confused with sticky rice).
Be careful not to buy the type marked with a red label from the same brand, since it will not turn out right.
Add enough hot water to the rice flour for a soft texture with the same consistency as your earlobes.
Form the dough into bite-sized balls and boil in hot water until they float up, then transfer to a plate.
They will stick together, so allow space in between.
Add a dollop of the sweetened bean paste on top and serve.
If you're in Japan, use shiratamako.



Put 1 cup of tangerine juice in sauce pan along with lemon juice, butter, and salt.

Add the cold water and mix with hands just until the dough holds together.
Do not knead!
Pie dough will be tough the more you work it.
Roll out on floured board or table.
This will give you enough dough for 2 pie crusts.



Set the oven to 425 defrees.
Prepare a non-stick baking sheet.
In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients.
Grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture; add in the yogurt.
Mix the dough with a wooden spoon (be careful not to over-work the dough) dough should be slightly sticky.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface.
Spread out the dough with hands to 1-1/2-inch thickness on the board.
Cut out 2-inch rounds, and place on a unlined non-stick baking sheet/tray.
Refrigerate for 30-40 minutes (this is an important step, the dough MUST be refrigerated for the suggested time).
Remove from the fridge; brush the tops with the whipping cream.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.
Best served warm from the oven.



Mix the floury ingredients together with a whisk.
Measure out the milk and water in a measuring cup.
Add the honey to the liquid and mix well to dissolve.
Put all the ingredients except for the shortening and butter in a bowl, and mix together until it's no longer floury.
Knead with a bread machine or mixer for 15 minutes.
When the dough forms a gluten film (the dough can be stretched out to a thin translucent sheet of gluten) stop kneading.
Divide the dough using a pastry cutter into about 10 pieces.
Return to the mixer or bread machine, add the butter and shortening, and knead for another 10 minutes.
When a gluten film forms again, take the dough out.
Form into a ball with a smooth, taut surface.
Put the dough in a plastic bag or container, and leave to rise overnight at room temperature, until it's 2 to 2.5 times its original volume.
(The rising time varies depending on the temperature of the room.)
If you leave it in a cool place near a window,for example, it will take about 10 hours.
In a warm place it will rise faster.
You can adjust the time by putting the dough the refrigerator.
The next morning, deflate the dough by folding it, and divide into 16 pieces.
Round off each portion into a smooth ball.
Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes.
After the dough has rested, press down to deflate and round off each piece into a smooth ball again, sealing the edges tightly.
LIne up the dough in an oiled square baking pan.
Use your oven's bread-rising setting to conduct the 2nd rising for 1-2 hours at 30C.
Leave the dough to rise until the tops are about 1 cm below the rim of the pan.
Cover with plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out.
When the dough has finished rising, preheat the oven to 190C.
Mix the sugar and cinnamon powder together to make cinnamon sugar.
Melt the butter (over hot water or in the microwave), and brush it evenly over the dough.
Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the dough generously.
Bake for about 18 minutes in a preheated 190C oven.
If it looks like the bread is browning too fast, cover with a piece of foil.
When the bread is baked, drop the pan onto your countertop from about a 30 cm height to force the steam out.
Take the bread out of the pan and cool on a rack.
Here I covered half the loaf with plain granulated sugar, and the other half with cinnamon sugar.
To fully enjoy the crunchy sugar top, it's best to eat this when it's fresh out of the oven, or just cooled.
If you cover the top with plastic, the plastic will stick to the sugar.
(See Hints.)
Here I made a version using a whole wheat sponger starter.
I made this on a warm day in May; the dough was left to rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature, then for 5-6 hours in the refrigerator, and it was just about right.
As a reference.
The bread looks like this when pulled apart.
Light and silky-smooth and chew.
Yummy!

He recommends slicing it into 8 huge slices like a cake to eat.
We love it this way, but more usually we cut it into normal bread slices, probably about 12 of them.
Notes:.
Make sure that the salt is well mixed into the flour because if salt comes into diret contact with the yeast it'll kill it (think salt on slugs -- ).
Using warm water is one of those things perpetuated in recipe books written by cooks who made the odd loaf but weren't bakers.
Warm water speeds up the rising process, but it's to the detriment of flavour (says baker Paul Hollywood).
Kneading - use a really lightly floured surface, like a dusting of talcum powder - and knead lightly with the heel of your palm and finger tips.
There's no need to cover the dough when rising (I did - Chef UK).
Sometimes, if you've left it for a long time, it gets a thickening on the outside, but don't worry.
There's no need to find a warm place either; just anywhere out of your way.
It'll take longer to rise, but the flavour will be better.
The dough is ready when doubled in size.
Knocking it back when it has risen will improve the flavour.
Shape the loaf rather than knead it (although I knead it lightly for 1-2 minutes Chef UK) - add olives or chopped nuts at this stage too.

Wheat flour contains two proteins, glutenin and gliadin.
When you combine flour with water, the proteins create a strong and elastic sheet called gluten.
Flours vary in their protein levels, which affects the texture of baked goods.
Gluten gives structure to yeast breads, but is not recommended for tender cakes, biscuits, and quick breads.
Southern all-purpose flour is milled from soft red winter wheat that has less gluten-forming protein.
It is typically bleached, which makes it whiter, but this does not affect the protein.
My family has always used White Lily flour, a staple across the South; another dependable Southern brand is Martha White.
Most national brands of all-purpose flour are a combination of soft winter wheat and higher-protein hard summer wheat.
White Lily contains approximately nine grams of protein per cup of flour, whereas national brands can contain eleven or twelve grams of protein per cup of flour.
If you live outside the South, White Lily is available online or in some specialty shops in other parts of the country.
For results similar to those of Southern flour, substitute one part all-purpose flour and one part cake flour for the amount of Southern flour in a recipe.
Finally, high-protein flour absorbs more liquid than does low-protein flour; if you attempt to make biscuits with a high-protein flour, you will need to add more liquid.
Self-rising flour is all-purpose flour that is low in protein and contains a leavening agent and salt.
It is widely available in the South, but less so in other regions of the country.
If you have a recipe that calls for self-rising flour, use the following formula to convert all-purpose into self-rising: to 1 cup of Southern all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt.

Remove pork from pan and set on a plate.
Turn down heat to medium, and add the balsamic vinegar.
Using a plastic spatula, scrape any bits off of the bottom of the pan, that's the good stuff!
Stir in dark brown sugar (can sub regular brown sugar, but dark is better), using spatula and keep scraping the bottom and stirring the sauce constantly.
Don't worry, it's very easy.
Do this for about 2-3 minutes til sauce has reduced and is thickened a little.

It will all get done at the same time with the resting time of the pork!

To start your culture, mix 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of warm water, a half teaspoon of rapid-rise yeast, and an opened pro-biotic capsule until smooth.
(You can get pro-biotics capsules at any health food store near the vitamin section.
Alternatively, you could add some active culture yogurt.)
Loosely cover the jar with the lid... (this keeps the bugs out and allows the wild yeast to enter).
(It is VERY important to not put the lid on tightly since great pressure would build and cause the jar to explode.
).
Stir regularly.
When the mixture has sponged up, stir down.
Starter can be used after the sponge has risen and fallen three times (one or two days).
Best taste is after the Hooch has formed and this will be in 3 to 5 days.
Additional Starter.
If you need more starter, then after a day or so... add flour/water in the ratio of 1/2 cup of flour to 1/3 cup of water.
Take some, leave some.
When you are ready to bake, pour out what you need and replace it in the ratio of 1/2 cup of flour to 1/3 cup of water.
When you dont need it for a few days, store in the fridge.
Feed it once a week.
(At some point, you may need to throw some away if you are not making a lot of bread.)
If you are going to be on vacation, freeze it.
When you need starter again... take it out a day or so early, feed it... and it will be ready to use on your baking day.

Use a fork to rake the mixture, breaking up the frozen parts into smaller chunks and pushing them toward the center like a pile of leaves.
Return the granita to the freezer and repeat the raking process twice more at 30 minute intervals until entirely frozen.
A fun variation on any granita is fruit drops, which I think of as a frozen version of Tootsie Pops, especially the part where you get to the sweet middle.
Pour the liquid mixture into an ice cube tray, then stick a few blueberries into each of the compartments.
Theyll end up suspended in the middle after the liquid freezes.
Put a toothpick or popsicle stick into each while they freeze and you can enjoy the fruit drops straight up, or skip the sticks and use them in beverages.
Either way, these fruit drops are a treat for the eyes, and great for people with mouth sores or anyone who wants to stay hydrated.

Sprinkle ribs evenly with salt.
Bring orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic and pepper to a boil in roasting pan over moderately high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
Add ribs in 1 layer using tongs, turning to coat, and cover pan tightly with foil.
Braise ribs in oven until very tender, about 2 hours.
(If making ahead, see cooks' note, below.
).
Before Serving:.
Reduce oven temperature to 200F.
Transfer ribs to a baking dish, arranging them in 1 layer, and keep warm in oven.
Skim fat from cooking liquid if desired, then make glaze by boiling liquid, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes.
Brush glaze generously on ribs.
Cooks' Note: Ribs can be braised 5 days ahead and cooled completely in cooking liquid, uncovered, then chilled, covering them once they are completely cold.
To reheat, set roasting pan with ribs and cooking liquid over moderate heat, covered with foil.
Simmer, covered, turning once, until they are heated through, about 15 minutes, then transfer ribs to a baking dish and keep warm.
Make glaze as directed.



Rinse the spring potatoes without peeling.
Heat oil in a pan.
Add the new potatoes and stir-fry over medium heat (about 5 minutes).
The potato skin becomes wrinkly when it's thoroughly cooked, so fry until you see that.
Add water and boil until you can poke through the potatoes with a skewer (about 15 minutes).
When there's not enough water, gradually add while it's simmering.
There should constantly be enough water so the potatoes are halfway covered.
When the potatoes are tender, dissolve the sugar and miso.
Simmer and reduce over high heat.
It's done when the broth has thickened .
About the miso: I use country-style miso that's slightly saltier than normal miso.
It's similar to koji miso.
If you're using either sweet or white miso, adjust the amount of sugar to about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons.
This is how it looks when you use ready-made blended miso (Kanto region style).
Each miso has its own flavor, so taste and experiment.
Warning: When there's too much oily water in Step 4, the miso will splatter.
Use just enough water to dissolve the miso, and discard the rest.

Bring cream, marmalade and butter to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Reduce heat slightly and cook until sauce has thickened, approximately 20 - 30 minutes.
The sauce takes on a golden colour and should thickly coat the back of a spoon.
(Watch towards the end of the cooking period or the butter will end up seperating from the sauce and it becomes tacky on the ice cream).
Spoon over ice cream.
Note: This sauce can be prepared while you are serving dinner.
The only draw back is that you need to periodically "stir the pot" so that the mixture does not burn.



To make the pancake like smooth katayif batter, you need to start out by mixing all dry ingredients in blender or food processor.
KEEP ASIDE 1/4 cup of water from the 3 cups you have and the bicarbonate of soda
While all dry ingredients are mixing together, slowly pour in the remaining of your water.
When well mixed, set aside for 2 hours.
After being set aside, mix in a separate bowl the bicarbonate soda and the 1/4 water.
Then mix gently in with the batter.
Get a flat surfaced nonstick pan to a medium heat (recommend not using a gas stove).
Then put the batter in a container that has a hole
When pouring the batter onto the hot pan, remember to keep your hand as steady as possible.

I made changes from Sarah Kramer's recipe, so do not expect it to be exactly the same if you find it in print.
She does not specify what kind of vegan milk to use.
Since I used coconut, I also cut down the amount of sugar.
I also use Raw Sugar or sometimes Agave syrup as those are better for you than refined sugars.
;-D Sarah Kramer has TONS of amazing Vegan recipes!
Her website is GoVegan.
net.
You can find her books and many other things there.
And if you want to buy her book she will sign and personalize it for no extra charge!!!

Mix together the sugar, salt, and curry powder.
In a medium skillet, heat the butter SLOWLY.
Don't just throw the butter into a hot skillet or it'll brown, and you don't want that.
You do, however, want to get the skillet good and hot so as to actually sear the scallops.
You'll know it's ready when the butter begins to get bubbly.
As your butter's heating up, roll each scallop in the sugar/salt/curry mixture.
Coat all sides.
If your butter's not hot enough yet, put them on a plate and wait until it's hot enough.
If you put them into the skillet and it's not hot enough, your coating will not caramelize and it'll slide right off the scallops!
Sear the scallops for about 3-4 minutes on each side.
With tons, transfer scallops to a plate when done; cover with aluminum foil.
Leave the butter in the skillet.
Reduce heat on the skillet to medium (still bubbly, but not searing temp) and add the sour cream.
Stir thoroughly and constantly as it cooks down into a sauce.

Preparation of rice.
Wash the rice and put in a colander to drain the water off for a while.
Then put it in a bowl (of the rice cooker) with the 180 ml water.
Leave it for more than 1 hour.
Cook the rice.
If you don't have a rice cooker, you can use a normal pot and an oven or a microwave.
If you use a pot, put a lid and heat it until boiling.
Then lower the heat and cook for about 15 minutes.
Stop heating and leave it for 10 minutes with the lid on.
In case of microwave, put in a microwavable bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Microwave for 5 minutes, then turn over the rice with a big spoon or spatula, and repeat it again.
After the last 5-min microwave, leave the bowl in the oven (with the plastic wrap on) for 10 minutes.
Mash the rice while it is hot.
We don't mash it completely but halfway (which is called "half-killing" in Japanese).
("Half-killed" sticky rice)
Prepare the bean jam and the kinako.
Microwave the bean jam if it is too wet (be careful, it will be very hot and you may burn your hands.

Fold in half again, form into a slug shape, and pinch the seams closed securely.
Line up the dough seam side down on a paper-lined baking sheet, and leave to rise (2nd rising).
Using the oven's "bread-rising" function, it takes about 25 minutes at 40C.
When the 2nd rising is complet, slash the tops and mist with plenty of water.
Bake in a 210C oven for 20 minutes, and the bread is done.
I doubled the recipe here.
This is the canned diced tomato brand I use.
It has a bit of spice mixed in, so I only used 3 g of salt.
Another tomato bread of mine is.



Rinse and pat very dry tilapia fillets.
In a small mixing bowl, blend raspberry vinegarette, honey, mustard and dill weed.
Grease or spray bottom of 13x9 baking dish, arrange fillets along the bottom in a single layer.
Drizzle raspberry vinegarette mixture evenly over the top of the fillets, coating each evenly.
Bake in oven at 350 degrees, uncovered for 20 minutes or until tilapia flakes easily with a fork.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Butter 9x13 baking dish.
Toss sliced potatoes with 2 tsp salt, pepper and rosemary.
Toss cheeses together.
(Feel free to use more than 3/4 cup of each- I do!)
Layer half the potatoes in the dish and sprinkle with half the cheese then top with remaining potatoes.
Whisk together sour cream, cream and 1 tsp salt.
Pour cream mixture over potatoes.
Tap dish on counter to settle ingredients and pop any air bubbles.
Top with remaining cheese.
Bake for one hour and fifteen minutes or until browned and tender.
Note: This dish should be prepared and baked the same day.
Do not refrigerate overnight.
Trust me.



Coat a metal rolling pin, pizza wheel, and marble board or the back of a baking sheet with the vegetable oil; set aside.
Cut the butter into a few pieces and melt in a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat.
Add the sugar, the water, and the salt; increase the heat to medium and cook the mixture until it registers 260F on a sugar thermometer (about 10 minutes), stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula.
Add 1/2 cup of the almonds and continue cooking until the mixture becomes golden brown and registers 305F on the thermometer (about 8 minutes), stirring constantly.
Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the mixture onto the oiled board.
With the oiled rolling pin, quickly spread out the mixture very thin.
It is necessary to work fast, because the mixture sets up rapidly and becomes too brittle to cut.
While still warm, with the oiled pizza wheel score the toffee into pieces that are 1 1/2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.
Let these centers set until cooled to room temperature (about 30 minutes).
Melt and temper the chocolate (see pages 2530).
Either dip the toffee in chocolate immediately, or store it in a tightly covered container at room temperature.
If left exposed to the air, the toffee will absorb moisture and become soft.
Line 3 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper.
Sprinkle the remaining 2 cups almonds on one of the prepared baking sheets.
Dip a toffee piece into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely.
With a dipper or fork, remove the toffee from the chocolate, gently shake off the excess chocolate, and drop the toffee into the chopped almonds.
Roll the toffee in the almonds, coating it thoroughly, and turn out onto the paper-lined sheets to set up completely, or chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the toffee will keep for 2 months in the refrigerator.
Substitute milk chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate.

The easy way: Throw it all into a bread machine and select dough.
When finished proceed to step 9.
The hard way: Dissolve yeast in warm water.
In a large bowl, combine butter, molasses, honey and salt and mix well.
Add yeast mixture and then gradually add flours.
Turn onto floured surface and knead until smooth.
Place in buttered bowl and let rise until double.
Punch down and let rest for a few minutes.
Divide dough into 4 parts and shape into loaves.
Place in greased pans and let rise for about an hour.
Bake at 375* for 35 to 40 minutes.



In a martini glass, lay a small scoop of ice cream in the bottom, sprinkle granola over the top and dress with some fresh raspberries and top with Cream de Coco.



Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic.
Lightly oil the entire surface and let stand until triple in size (2 1/2 to 3 hours).
Turn dough out on a floured board and punch down.
Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, then knead for about 5 minutes.
Divide dough into 2 parts.
Place one piece into bowl and cover.
Divide the first section into 12 parts.
At this point you may add any desired filling or continue with unfilled buns.
[ Flatten each section in the palm of your hand.
Place one tablespoon of filling in the center and form dough into a ball around the filling.]
Lightly roll each part into a ball.
Put each ball on a wax or parchment paper square.
Cover and let stand until doubled (about 30 minutes).
Repeat with the rest of the dough.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees .
Place buns on a lightly oiled baking pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 18 minutes (until golden brown).
Serve warm.



Rinse the soy beans quickly, and soak them in water.
It depends on how warm it is, but if you soak them for about half a day (10 - 20 hours) and the soy beans swell up to about 3 times their original size, that's plenty.
As a general rule, aim for the "ambient temperature + soaking time in hours" to total 30.
But it does depend on the temperature.
Put the soaked soy beans plus some of the soaking liquid (400 ml) in a blender and blend.
If you don't have 400 ml of liquid, add water.
This pulverized mixture is called "namago" (raw soy base).
Put the namago from Step 2 into a large pot, and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes.
Spread out a piece of undyed coarsely woven cotton or a large cotton or linen kitchen towel in a bowl (one that's been sewn up into a bag is best suited for this).
Add the Step 3 soy-water liquid to this, and squeeze it out very very well, being careful not to burn yourself.
The squeezed out liquid is 'soy milk', and the fibers left in the cloth is 'okara'.
I got 500 ml of soy milk and 120 g of okara.
The okara is just like the okara sold at tofu stores.
From here on are some extra things: It's really easy to make yuba (tofu skin) from the soy milk!
Put the soy milk in a pan and just heat it up.
A skin will form on the surface.
This is yuba!
To make tofu from the soy milk: Warm up the soy milk to 75C.
Put some nigari (magnesium chloride) in a bowl, and pour the warmed soy milk into the bowl.
After a while (don't touch the contents of the bowl in the meantime) the soy will coagulate, and the tofu is done.
The amount of nigari to use varies, so read the package directions.
Why does nigari make soy milk coagulate?
The magnesium chloride in nigari coagulates the protein in the soy milk.
Calcium sulphate, calcium chloride, glucono delta lactone etc.
are used as coagulants too, according to a book on food chemistry.
Can you make tofu using everyday coagulating agents?
You can add kanten, agar, gelatin and so on to make pseudo-tofu.
Kanten-set tofu has been popular since the kanten boom started.
(Translator's note: kanten became popular a few years ago in Japan as a weight-loss aid.)
However, if you simmer "tofu" that's set in this way it will just melt away, so you can't use it in heated dishes.



Mix 3 oz (84 grm).
powdered strawberry jell-o with the 3 cups (700 ml) sugar.

1.)
PREPARE pressure canner.
Heat jars and lids in simmering water until ready for use.
Do not boil.
Set bands aside.
2.)
BROWN meat in oil in a large saucepot.
Add vegetables and seasonings to browned meat.
Cover with boiling water.
Bring stew to a boil.
Remove from heat.
3.)
LADLE hot stew into hot jars leaving 1 inch headspace.
Remove air bubbles.
Wipe rim.
Center hot lid on jar.
Apply band and adjust until fit is fingertip tight.
4.)
PROCESS filled jars in a pressure canner at 10 pounds pressure 1 hour and 15 minutes for pints and 1 hour and 30 minutes for quarts, adjusting for altitude.
Remove jars and cool.
Check lids for seal after 24 hours.
Lid should not flex up and down when center is pressed.



Preheat oven to 350F.
Place chicken in 6x10 baking dish.
Sprinkle with onion flakes.
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, honey and garlic powder and pour mixture evenly over chicken.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
Spread green peppers and mushrooms evenly over chicken, and continue to bake, covered 20 or more minutes until mushrooms are tender.



Wash 4 half-pint canning jars and rest them on a cake rack at the bottom of a tall stock pot.
Cover the jars with at least 1 inch of water and bring to a soft boil.
(A rack can be improvised by tying several canning rings together with string.)
Keep a kettle of water on the boil to sterilize lids later.
Place sugar in a shallow baking dish in a 250 degree oven for 15 minutes.
(Warming the sugar makes it dissolve more readily.)
Place the berries into a medium-sized heavy bottomed pot and place on high heat.
Use a potato masher to crush the fruit.
Bring to a full rolling boil for 1 min, stirring constantly.
Add the warm sugar to the hot berries and return to a full boil until the mixture gels, stirring to avoid scorching.
Gelling can be tested a few ways:
1.)
When a candy thermometer reads 220 degrees
2.)
When a cold teaspoon dipped into the syrup collects on the edge of the spoon and sheets rather than dripping off
3.)
Using a chilled plate, place a dollop of hot jam and return it to the freezer for 2 minutes.
After 2 minutes, push the cooled jam with your finger and if the surface wrinkles its ready to be packed.
You can also tilt the plate to see if the jam moves, if it moves very slowly its ready.
The time it takes for the raspberries to reach gel stage varies anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes depending on the moisture content in your fruit.
Remove jam from heat.
Place canning lids (not rings) in a bowl and cover with boiling water.
The lids need to stand for a couple of minutes to soften the sealant material.
Use a canning jar lifter, or tongs to lift your hot jar, pouring all of the water out.
Pour jam into a glass measuring cup to ease filling the jam jars leaving a 1/2 of headspace.
Clean up any dribbles on lip of the jar using a clean dishtowel dipped in boiling water.
Grab a hot lid using a pair of tongs and place on the jar, screw on the canning ring until just snug.
You want to avoid screwing the band on too tightly as air needs to escape later.
Fill remaining jars.
Carefully lower the filled jars into the stock pot.
Arrange the jars so that they stand upright and do not touch.
Make sure the jars are covered with at least 1 inch of water and bring to a boil.
Once the water comes to a strong boil, process for 10 minutes.
Higher elevations may need to add more time, these can be looked up online.
After 10 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the jars to remain in the hot water for 5 more minutes.
Remove jars from water and place on a cutting board in an undisturbed spot.
They should seal if not immediately, in 12-24 hours.
You should hear a sucking sound and the lid will be concave in the middle.
In the event the jars dont seal, consume the jam immediately and store in the refrigerator.
Properly canned jam can be stored up to a year in cool dark spot.



Making bread can be easy to do, but you must have the right tools.
Most importantly, you will need a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and a dough hook.
Also, make sure your mixing bowl is warm by swirling some hot water around until the bowl feels warm on its outside.
Now you are ready to start.
Pour the warm water into the bowl and sprinkle yeast over the top of it.
Stir with a fork to help dissolve the yeast.
Let mixture sit for 5 minutes or so until it gets foamy.
While mixing with the paddle attachment, start adding oil, salt, buttermilk, baking soda, and sugar.
Add flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing after each addition.
Continue adding and mixing until dough starts to ball up on the paddle.
Switch to the dough hook and continue mixing and adding flour until dough is only slightly sticky and is pulling away from the sides of the bowl.
Do not put too much flour in.
The dough will be very soft and slightly sticky.
Put dough into a large, greased bowl and cover loosely with a towel and put in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until doubled in size.
Punch dough down and turn out on a floured surface.
Pat or roll out to about 3/4 inch thick.
I use a biscuit cutter to cut out dough and shape into golfball size rolls.
Put on a greased 13x9 baking pan leaving about 1 inch space between them.
Again, cover loosely with a towel and put in a warm place for 3045 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 1520 minutes until golden brown.
Put on a wire rack to cool.



Combine all ingredients and heat on stove to desired temperature (but not boiling!
You might scorch the milk).



Mix and bake



Cook noodles in boiling salted water for about 8 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water.
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a pan and add the noodles, place over a slow fire, heat well.

In a large stock pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil.
Once hot, add the garlic, onions and carrots and saute them until they are soft (five or ten minutes).
Meanwhile, cut the sausage into bite size pieces.
Once the veggies have softened, put the sausage into the pot and allow it to brown a bit.
Stir in the chicken broth, cream of mushroom soup and saurkraut.
Bring to a boil, then stir in the mustard.
Let the soup simmer slightly for no less than four hours.
The longer it heats, the better it will taste.
Thats the golden rule of soups.
Add the cubed potatoes before you serve the soup and cook them until they have reached your desired level of tenderness.
It will take longer for them to cook if they are cut into big pieces, and it will take less time if they are little.
Typically it will take between 10 and 20 minutes for them to be done.
Just add them into the soup and monitor their doneness to suit your tastes.
Then serve!



Combine lime juice, oil, honey, soy sauce, and ginger.
Add scallops and toss to coat.

Place in floured bowl, cover and let rise for an hour or so.
Shape and put on toppings, then bake at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-14 minutes (until crust is golden brown).
This dough is also great for calzones.



Sift the flour and salt together into a small bowl and set aside.
In a large bowl and using an electric mixer on low speed, beat the butter and cream cheese until smoothly blended, about 45 seconds.
Mix in the flour mixture until the dough holds together and forms large clumps that come away from the sides of the bowl, about 30 seconds.
Or, use a large spoon to stir the butter and cream cheese together until smoothly blended, then add the flour and salt and continue stirring until clumps of smooth dough form.
Form the dough into a smooth ball, flatten it into a 6-inch disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or as long as overnight.
The dough is now ready to roll and use in the recipes.
Variation: To make 2 crusts double the ingredients.



Thinly slice green onions, using the bulb and most of the tops.
I usually stop chopping once I get close to the end of the tops, as it gets pretty flimsy.

When the lowfat milk thickens to the consistency of cake batter, that happens almost immediately, remove and set aside.
(If the lowfat milk does not thicken easily, add in 1 Tbsp.. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp.. cool lowfat milk.)
Stir in the vanilla extract.
Pour the mix into a fancy serving dish and allow to cold.
Chill for at least 3 hrs to enable the pudding to set.
When the pudding feels hard (test by tipping the bowl gently), garnish with cherries or possibly your favorite fat-free topping.
Serve.

in brine for 2 hours up to over night.
Cover and store in the refrigerator.
Remove chicken from brine and rinse chicken well.
You are now ready to make a tender juicy chicken dish of your choosing.
NOTES: You can do this with turkey, as well.
Also, you will notice that your leftovers, even after refrigerated overnight, are so tender and juicy whether eaten cold or reheated.
The moisture retention really helps to make a chicken meal morph into a second meal when it holds its moisture.
If doing a whole turkey, use the recipe servings changer to up the servings to 6-10.
Put your turkey in an insulated cooler with enough water to cover and add in a 5 pound bag of ice.
Brine overnight.

1.
Using a stand mixer (trust me), put the water, yeast, and Splenda/sugar in the bowl.
Walk away for 5 minutes.
2.
Come back and add the olive oil, wheat gluten, and 1C rye flour.
Mix thoroughly, then walk away.
I like to watch TV for this part.
Come back in about a half an hour, give or take.
Let the sponge form.
3.
When its a part you dont like or your show is over or whatever, come back.
Push down the sponge and add the rest of the rye flour and the salt, then slowly add the wheat flour while your mixer is on a low-setting.
You wont be able to get it all in this is a good thing.
4.
When the dough looks about right (usually just over halfway through the wheat flour), pull it out and begin kneading it.
I do most of this by feeling, but my general rule when kneading bread is to get it to resist you when you poke it.
Not to inflict pain, but to be semi-firm.
Roughly 10 minutes, although Im lazy.
This should incorporate most of your remaining flour.
5.
At this point, determine how fast you want this thing done.
I like to oil a pizza pan and plop the dough straight on, in which case you need only one rise and get a round, sloping loaf.
The other option is to do a double or even triple rise more and longer rises means a fluffier loaf.
Two ways Ive done this
a.
Oil a pizza pan and center the ball of dough, then cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place.
Make sure the cloth is loose, because this can rise pretty well.
Let rise for at least an hour, but possibly as long as two.
Multi-task.
Do laundry.
Tell your family youre busy baking and cant possibly help them, and watch TV instead.
When its ready (you get a feel for what you like, but wait at least 2 hours the first time), pop in a 350F oven for about 40 minutes.
(I use my moms oven, which allows me to set a proof cycle I just take off the cloth and turn the oven on, and take it out exactly 42 minutes later.)
b.
Oil a bowl and toss the dough in, making sure to coat the top.
Let rise once for about an hour or so, then put into a greased bread pan, let rise a second time, then poke so it falls evenly, and let rise a third time (about 3 hours of rising) and bake as above.
Depending on how long you let it rise, this can be great for anything from eggs on toast to sandwiches.
The knack to this recipe lies in being able to walk away from it for extended periods of time.
Also, in experimentation try nuts, fruit, etc.

When it comes to a boil turn the heat down to low, and simmer until the beans are tender (about 30 minutes).
Add 1/2 the amount of sugar to the pot, and shake the pot to dissolve the sugar.
Add the rest of the sugar and dissolve.
Turn off the heat, and leave the pot so that the beans can absorb more moisture.
Turn the heat back on.
When it starts to bubble, turn the heat down to low and simmer while stirring gently with a wooden spatula.
If you can see the bottom of the pot if you scrape it with the spatula, add the salt and the beans are done.
If the beans are a bit liquid when hot, they will stiffen when cool.

Mix the milk and yogurt together in a glass or pottery container (Do not use metal).
Place lid on it, but don't seal it (sealed starters have been known to explode).
Put mixture in a warm place (80 to 90 degrees) for about 24 hours.
The yogurt and milk will separate forming a large curd, when adding the flour just stir it all back together.
Add the flour stir, and put back in warm place for 3 to 5 days; stirring daily.
It will bubble and have the odor of fermentation--it is ready to use.
Remember the starter is a living thing and needs to be fed and fed frequently when an infant.
I feed the "infant" weekly by placing it on the counter for several hours and allowing it to come to room temperature.
Then remove 1/2 cup starter, discarding the remainder.
Feed the 1/2 cup with equal amounts of milk (buttermilk will produce a stronger sour taste) and unbleached flour; i.e.
1 cup flour and 1 cup milk plus 1/2 cup of starter.
If you would like, you can feed the starter with 1/3 cup dry milk powder and 2/3 cup bottled water in place of the 1 cup milk.

Unfortunately, creme fraiche is not easily found in the United States and what is available is often very expensive.
However, creme fraiche can be made simply and reasonably at home.
To make , pour theheavy cream into a clean jar, add thebuttermilk or yogurt, cover the jar tightly, and shake it for about a minute.
Then just leave the jar on the counter for 12 to 24 hours, or until the creme fraiche thickens slightly.
How quickly it thickens will depend on the temperature of the roomthe warmer the room, the quicker the thickening action.
When it has thickened, chill the creme fraiche in the refrigerator for a day before you use it.
Creme fraiche can be kept covered in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks and (or but, depending on your taste) will get tangier and tangier day after day.

Cook green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
Using a large diameter strainer, transfer beans to a large bowl of ice water, cool completely.
Drain well.
(At this point you can make the beans a day ahead, store in refrigerator.)
Alternatively you can steam the beans for 5 minutes and proceed directly to the skillet.
Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a heavy large skillet over medium hight heat.
Whisk in 1 Tbsp of fresh thyme, 1 Tbsp of mustard and 1 teaspoon of garlic salt into butter.
Add beans to skillet and toss until heated through, about 4 minutes.

Sprinkle the cereal/flour mixture evenly over the apple mixture.
Bake in the preheated 325F oven for about 45 min.
Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of each serving.



Sift the flour and salt together into a medium bowl.
Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
Sprinkle 10 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and use a fork or the pastry blender to toss the mixture together, adding more water, a little at a time, until you can gather the dough into a ball with your hands.
Handling the dough as little as possible, form it into two balls and wrap them in plastic wrap.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
You can even freeze the dough for up to 1 month; thaw it in the refrigerator for 1 day before using it.
To roll out the dough: Work with one ball of dough at a time.
Sprinkle the work surface with a little flour.
Unwrap the dough and place it on the flour.
Starting in the center and using even pressure, roll the rolling pin away from you toward the outer edge.
Give the dough a 1/4 turn, sprinkle with more flour and roll out from the center again.
Repeat the rolling, turning and flouring until you have a circle about 1/8-inch thick.
Hold the pie plate over the dough to make sure the circle is about 2 inches wider than the plate all around.
To lift the pie crust: Wrap the dough over the rolling pin and lift it over the pie plate.
Unroll the dough evenly onto the plate.
Gently press the dough into the bottom.
If making a single-crust pie, trim the excess, roll the edge under, then crimp as in the picture above.
If making a double-crust pie, spoon the filling into the bottom crust, roll out the second ball of dough and cover the filling.
Press the edges together to seal the two crusts.
Trim away the excess, leaving 1 inch hanging over the edge.
Roll the edge under then pinch the edge to crimp, as above.
With the tip of a knife, cut 2 or 3 slits in the top crust so the steam can escape while baking.

Line a heatproof surface like a countertop or 2 baking sheets with wax paper.
In an 8-cup microwave-safe glass measuring cup with a handle, combine the brown sugar, cream and corn syrup, mixing until all the sugar lumps are dissolved and the batter is well blended.
Position the measuring cup in the microwave so you can see how the batter inside measures; the batter will be at or near the 2 1/2-cup mark.
Microwave on high without covering or stirring, watching it continuously, until the mixture slowly bubbles up to slightly higher than the 8-cup mark and then deflates to near the 4 1/2-cup mark, 10 to 16 minutes (depending on how quickly your microwave cooks).
Do not open the microwave during the cooking process and, if in doubt, cook for less time, not more.
If you want to make praline sauce instead of pralines, let the batter cook as directed until it has expanded to slightly over the 8-cup mark and then has slowly deflated just to the 7-cup mark.
Use warm or at room temperature.
Refrigerate the leftovers, tightly covered, for up to 1 week.
Carefully remove the very hot measuring cup from the microwave and, using a sturdy metal mixing spoon, gently stir in the pecans, butter and vanilla, being careful to not splash any of the hot mixture on your skin.
Continue stirring until the mixture is noticeably less glossy, about 3 minutes.
Working quickly, and using two spoons, scoop rounded tablespoonfuls of the mixture onto the wax paper, about 1 inch apart and, using a second tablespoon to push the batter off the mixing spoon.
If necessary, thin the batter with the remaining 1 to 3 teaspoons of cream as you reach the end of the batter and it thickens as it cools.
Let the pralines cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, then serve as soon as possible.
Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.



Mix yeast, water and sugar.
Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, dried milk and salt.
Pour in the oil and yeast/water mixture and stir well.
You might need to add more flour or water, depending on the absorbency of the flour.
Knead dough briefly, divide into 18 egg sized balls.
Place on a floured surface, cover and let rest for 15-30 minutes.
Roll one ball out and cook in a skillet until large "bubbles" form.
Flip pita over and cook the other side for a few more minutes.
I flatten it out with a spatula.
Keep bread warm (wrap in a towel or place in a ziploc bag) while cooking the rest of the bread.
These freeze well.



Add Brussels sprouts to large pot of boiling water; cook 6 min.

If you need to reheat or refluff the couscous, just add a teaspoon olive oil and lightly mix with a fork.



Put all the bread dough ingredients in a bread maker, and press start.
Wait until the 1st rising has finished.
Check the dough after 5 minutes, and if it's floury, add 1 ~ 2 tablespoons of water.
If it's watery, add 1 - 2 tablespoons of flour.
When the cycle is finished, press the air out from the dough.
Divide into 4 - 6 portions, and roll into balls.
Let rest for 15 minutes.
Press the air out again, flatten the dough, and roll out with a rolling pin into 10 - 12 cm diameter circles.
Place on a baking sheet and let them rise for the second time (2nd rising).
(30 minutes in the oven with the bread-rising function is an estimate.)
Preheat the oven to 190C.
Make little dents at 2 cm intervals on the dough with your fingers (or with a 1 cm diameter stick).
Brush with the olive oil, and sprinkle with grated cheese, minced rosemary, and garlic powder.
Bake in the oven for 8 minutes and they're done.
Let cool for 5 - 10 minutes, and enjoy.
You can stretch out the dough in a baking sheet instead of making small individual breads.
Cut into pieces at the end.
(I doubled the ingredients in this photo).
I used the same amount as in this recipe and made one huge bread.



Mix all ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl large enough to fit both of your hands.
Put the bowl in the microwave for 20 seconds, or until the mixture is quite warm, but still comfortable to touch.
Soak your hands in the mixture for 10 minutes.
When you are done soaking, take your hands out, rinse them briefly with lukewarm water, and pat dry.
Add your favorite moisturizer if desired.



Temper the chocolate (see the note in the short description).
This can be done by hand, or with a tempering unit.
The tempering unit is MUCH easier.
With a hand mixer, beat peanut butter and powdered sugar together, until combined and fluffy.
You can use foil cupcake wrappers, or silicone, of any size.
(I have a grande size featured in the picture.)
Fill wrappers 1/2 way with chocolate.
Using a brush (or fingers), make sure the sides of the cupcake wrappers are completely covered with chocolate.
Pipe in peanut butter mixture, filling cups 2/3 full.
Cover with tempered chocolate, making sure to cover all the peanut butter.
Refrigerate for 25 minutes.
Enjoy!



Add the water,butter,honey in the bread machine.
Add dry milk, salt and flour.
Add yeast in a groove on top of the flour.
You can make the bread on the White bread cycle or on the Dough cycle.
When the Beep comes on; add Oatmeal.
If you chose the dough cycle remove and shape into one loaf or 2 smaller ones.
Sprinkle a bit of oatmeal on top.
Preheat oven 375*.
Let rise app 40 minutes.
Lower heat to 350* and bake at app 30 minutes.
Optional; use 1/2 whole wheat flour.
SUCCESS HINTS: For added texture, add the oats after the first knead or at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle.
For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaf after the final rise.
When you are baking it in the machine and you see it rising to the top while it is baking, use a needle to make a few tiny holes to punch it slowly down and it avoids having it ruin the top of the bread.
Instant oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do.

Fire up any kind of smoker: dry, water, electric, side or stovetop.
Keep heat very low, under 230 degrees if possible.
Stem your peppers, but don't seed them.
Place peppers in a single layer on the grate.
Using pecan (traditionally) or another wood according to your taste, bring up a good dense smoke.
Keep the smoke as dense as possible, while keeping a very close eye on the heat.
When using a stovetop smoker, after bringing the smoker up to temperature and producing smoke, reduce the heat to low.
The process will take a lot longer but you won't cook your peppers.
Check them every hour or so.
They're ready when they have shrivelled up and look like dark leather.
I just put mine in a canning jar, put on the lid and keep them in the cupboard.
They keep nearly forever, if they are smoked through.

MIX grapes, almonds and cinnamon in small bowl.



Mix all ingredients and blend until smooth.



Combine all ingredients (reserve about 1/2 cup of flour) and mix thoroughly in a large mixing bowl.
Add reserved flour a tablespoon at a time to mixture until a soft, smooth dough is formed.
You may not need the whole amount or you may need more.
Anyway, add JUST enough flour until dough comes away from bowl and it doesn't stick to your fingers (ie the dough becomes manageable) Remember, the more flour you add while kneading, the heavier and drier your loaf will be.
Turn dough out on lightly greased surface and knead for a while, about 10mins.
Cover and let rise for about 1 hour, until puffy (dough might not double in bulk).
Transfer dough to a lightly greased surface and shape it into a 8" log.
Transfer log to a lightly greased loaf pan (8 1/2" x 4 1/2"), cover the pan with plastic proof cover (i just cover with a greased cling wrap, loosely).
Let dough rise for about 1 hour, until outer edge has risen about 1" over the rim of the pan.

Uncover pan and bake for 35-40mins, tenting lightly with foil for the final 10-15mins if the top is browning too quickly.
Remove bread from oven, take it out of the pan, and cool on wire rack.
After 15mins, brush with butter, if desired; to give loaf an exceptionally soft crust.
NOTE 1: I've tried substituting 2 tbsp lecithin granules for half of the butter (2 tbsp lecithin+ 2 tbsp butter)- it makes an even more tender loaf, and extends the shelf life a bit.
NOTE 2:You may also use 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk+ 1 1/8 cup of lukewarm water to replace the milk called for in recipe.
NOTE 3: Potato flour (1/4 cup) may be replaced with 1/3 cup potato flakes.

To make the outer dough, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times to combine.
Sprinkle in the pieces of lard and process for 10 seconds to blend well, or until the mixture looks like coarse meal.
(Alternatively, put the ingredients in a bowl and use a pastry blender or your fingers in a quick rubbing motion to combine the flour and shortening.)
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, make a well in the center, and work in the water 1 tablespoon at a time.
Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir, fold, and push the ingredients into a ragged mass.
Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently knead for about 2 minutes to create a very soft , smooth, and slightly elastic dough.
Press your finger into the dough; it should slowly bounce back, leaving a faint indentation.

Push it from the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface.
Gently pat and roll the dough into a smooth ball and set aside.
Wrap in plastic wrap if the outer dough needs to rest longer.
To encase the inner dough in the outer dough, roll the outer dough into a 6- to 7-inch-diameter circle.
(Try your best to work on a minimally floured surface at all times, to prevent the dough from absorbing too much flour and toughening.)
Center the ball of inner dough on top and then gently pull up and press the outer dough, pinching the ends together to completely encase the inner dough.
Hold the dough in both hands to make this easier.
Use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough into an oblong, about 8 inches wide and 12 inches long.
Start each pass from the center and move toward one of the edges before rolling back again.
Try to square off the sides and lift up the dough occasionally to prevent sticking.
If a bit of the inner dough leaks out, pat some flour on it to seal.
Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, with one end toward the middle and the other end on top to cover, resulting in a rectangle about 8 inches wide and 4 inches long.
Turn the dough 90 degrees so that one of the unfolded sides points at you.
Roll the dough out again to an 8 by 12-inch rectangle, and fold again into a letter.
Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or overnight, before using.

Drain on paper towel, then lay strips on oven racks or if you have a dehydrator on the shelves.
Dry meat till it is still bendable not crunchy--keep checking; It should be about 6-9 hours depending on the thickness of the meat.
If using an oven, turn it to about 200F so it dries evenly.



Get a cup of water heat it up in microwave until hot
Put cocoa in hot water
Add the sugar next
Last add the dry powder milk.. its not liquid even though on the package it looks like liquid.
It comes in a powder form
Stir all ingredients together
Drink and enjoy :)



Cream the butter for one minute.
Add the Parmesan, thyme, salt and pepper.
Slowly add the flour and combine until the mixture is in large crumbles, about one minute (an electric mixer works best).
Dump the dough onto a floured board, press into a couple of balls, and roll each ball into a 3-inch log.
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or for up to 4 days.
You can also freeze the rolls for a couple of months.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cut the log into 3/8-inch rounds with a small, sharp knife and place them on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 22 minutes, until lightly browned.



Combine all ingredients in the bowl of food processor or blender.
Blend or pulse on high for 30-40 seconds, or until desired consistency.
If thinner butter is desired, more oil can be added, but I found it kinda just increased the oil without thinning the texture a sufficient amount.
Should keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks.
Because of the coconut oil this will become more firm with refrigeration.



You will need a small skillet and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded Parmesan cheese.
You will also need a bowl or footed ice cream dish for your mold.
Heat the skillet on medium heat.
Sprinkle a circle of cheese into the skillet approximately double the size of the bowl that you wish to make.
Make sure that the cheese is not to thick or too thin.
Heat until the cheese bubbles then remove from the heat to cool for just a couple of minutes.
Once the cheese has cooled use a spatula to gently lift the cheese and drape it across the bowl that you are using for a mold.
Use your hands to gently shape the bottom and sides of the bowl.
The cheese is fragile but also malleable.
Let the bowls cool.
If you leave the cheese to bubble a bit longer it will start to pop like popcorn.
Now I do not mean it will pop out of the pan (a couple of strays will) but more like each shred of cheese will pop and expand.
Let 90% of the cheese do this before you remove it from the heat.
Your bowl will have more color, crunch and nutty flavor if you leave it on the heat a bit longer.
But be careful not to burn your cheese.
Spoon in a big spoonful of my Creamy Crab Salad recipe also posted on TastyKitchen.

Have fun!



Ingredients to serve up to four.
1 Remove bottoms of asparagus spears and peel each to about two inches from the tip.
In a large pot heat two qts of salted water and cook asparagus 3 to 4 min.
2 Combine orange juice and zest in a small saucepan.
Cook mix, over a medium heat, till you have only one quarter c. of liquid.
Remove from heat, and whisk into your quarter c. of orange, the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
3 Transfer asparagus carefully to paper towels to drain.
You can sprinkle with salt and pepper or possibly let the vinaigrette do all the work.
Now divide the asparagus into four plates and drizzle your orange vinaigrette over the asparagus.
Your ready to serve a wonderful dish.
Serves four.



Boil onions till tender (20-30 min).
In saucepan heat butter and add in salt and pepper.
Stir constantly.
Add in flour and lowfat milk; simmer till creamy (15 min).
Pour sauce over onions and sprinkle with minced parsley (if you like).
Serve in casserole dish.
Serves 6.



Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-x-15 1/2-x-1/2-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end.
Batter: Pour the cream, corn syrup, and sugar into a 1 1/2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Stir to combine, then add the butter.
Stir over medium-low heat until the butter melts.
Then raise the heat to medium, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon--especially toward the end of cooking--to prevent scorching.
Cook until the mixture reaches 238 degrees F, the soft-ball stage, on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes; the mixture will appear between ivory- and straw-colored.
Remove from heat, and stir in almonds.
Pour the mixture onto the center of the foil-lined baking sheet, and spread it in as thin a layer as possible.
A pool about 8 inches in diameter is fine.
Bake for 3 minutes; then spread the more liquid mixture evenly over the baking sheet.
If the mixture still does not completely cover the baking sheet, bake another minute, then tilt the baking sheet to allow the mixture to spread evenly.
Bake for about 5 to 6 minutes total, or until golden but not dark brown.
Though the mixture bubbles while baking, the bubbles form more slowly toward the end of baking time than at the beginning.
Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
While the mixture is still warm but no longer liquid, cut 1 1/2-inch squares using a ruler and a pastry wheel.
If the mixture is too warm, it will not cut cleanly.
If it is too cool, it will splinter or not cut; in that case return it to the oven for a few seconds to soften it a bit.
Decoration: When the squares are completely cool, place the chocolate in a bowl over water at about 120 degrees F. When about two-thirds of the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the water.
With a dry rubber spatula, stir until the liquid chocolate melts the soft or unmelted chocolate that remains.
Fill a small handmade paper cone with the chocolate and snip off the tip.
Pipe thin lines of chocolate back and forth over the squares' surface.
Refrigerate the squares briefly, just to set the chocolate.
Remove from the refrigerator and set aside in a cool, dry place.
To store, remove squares from the foil and place them in layers, separated by strips of aluminum, in an airtight metal or plastic container in a cool place up to 1 week.



Blend ingredients and shape into a roll 1-1/4 inches in diameter.
At this point you can refrigerate or freeze in an airtight container until needed.
Slice into 1/8 inch slices and prick them several times with a fork.
Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 8-10 mins in a 375 degree oven.
Watch closely because crackers brown quickly.
If the crackers on the outside brown before the center, remove the outer crackers and continue to bake rest.



Cook potatoes in boiling water in large saucepan 20 min.
or until tender; drain.
Cool.
Place potatoes in large bowl.
Add all remaining ingredients except dressing; mix lightly.
Add dressing; stir gently.



Toss the flour and salt into the workbowl of a food processor and pulse a couple of times to combine.
Cut the butter into 1/4-inch cubes and sprinkle them over the flour in the workbowl.
Add the lard in 2 or 3 pieces.
Process with 15 rapid on-off pulses or just til the biggest lumps of flour-covered fat are no bigger than a few small peas.
Add 3 tablespoons of ice water through the feed tube and pulse 5 times.
Feel the dough and makesure its just damp enough to hold together when you squeeze a bit in your hand.
If not, add the last tablespoon of water and pulse 5 more times.
The dough will be loose and ragged (dont overprocess it into a ball).
Dump the dough out onto a work surface.
Push the dough with the heel of your hand 2 or 3 times to flatten out some of the lumps of fat.
Then gather the dough into a ball.
Flour the work surface and roll the dough out with a floured rolling pin into a circle 12 1/2 inches in diameter.
Fold the dough in half and put it into a 9-inch pie pan.
Unfold it and press it into the pan, trimming the edges if you need to.
Roll the edge under and shape a high fluted edge all around.
Toss the finished pie shell into the freezer to chill while making the filling.



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Sift dry ingredients (flour through baking soda) together into a large mixing bowl.
In a medium sized bowl mix pumpkin and milk together with a whisk until smooth.
Using the largest holes on a box grater, grate frozen butter and add it into the dry ingredients.
Mix fairly well with a spatula then add the wet ingredients and only mix until most of the flour is gone (batter will be lumpy).
Turn dough out onto a floured cutting board or counter top and knead with your hands a couple of time but dont over-mix!
Batter will still be a bit rough.
Form dough into a disk then roll it out with a rolling pin to 3/4 inch thick.
Use a 3 inch biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out biscuits.
Re-roll the scraps of dough and cut out remaining biscuits.
Place biscuits on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes.
Take the pan out of the oven and brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter.
Put pan back in oven for 3 minutes to finish baking.
Remove from oven and serve warm!
Super wonderful with apple butter!



Mix the applesauce and cinnamon to form a stiff dough.

Place over medium-high heat, bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.



Remove the ribs from packaging and using a sharp knive slit the membrane on the bone side of the rack and attempt to remove as much of it as you can.
It is edible so don't worry if you can't get it all.
Rinse the ribs under cold water and allow to sit at room temperature while you make the rub.
Mix the Paprika, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Chilli Powder, Oregano, Basil, Ground Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper to make the rub.
Using a basting brush put a thin layer of the yellow mustard on both sides of the rack.
Sprikle the rub onto both sides in as even a coat as possible.
Preheat your grill to 225 F leaving one side of the grill off.
Take your time doing this and make sure the temperature stays within 5 F to allow even cooking temperature.
Place the racks of ribs on the side of the grill with no direct heat with the bone side down.
Cook ribs for 4 - 6 Hours depending on your grill.
About 30 minutes before you remove the ribs, baste them with the Bbq sauce and allow to turn into a glaze on the ribs.
Remove the ribs and cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes before eating to allow the meat to rest.
Enjoy.



Layer the strawberries and sugar in a large bowl.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Prepare for water-bath canning: Sterilize the jars and keep them hot in the canning pot, and put the flat lids in a heatproof bowl.
(See below for details.)
Using care not to damage the strawberries, gently transfer them with the sugar to a wide, 6- to 8-quart preserving pan.
Bring to a simmer, gently stirring, then continue to cook for 5 minutes.
Pour into a colander set over a large bowl.
Return the juice to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat.
Boil, stirring occasionally, until the syrup is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes.
Return the strawberries and any accumulated juice to the pan, along with the lemon juice, and bring to a simmer.
Simmer, stirring frequently, until the strawberries are glossy and very tender but still hold their shape, about 20 minutes.
Skim off as much foam as you can, then remove from the heat and stir gently for a few seconds to distribute the fruit in the liquid.
Ladle boiling water from the canning pot into the bowl with the lids.
Using a jar lifter, remove the sterilized jars from the canning pot, carefully pouring the water from each one back into the pot, and place them upright on a folded towel.
Drain the water off the jar lids.
Ladle the hot preserves into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace at the top.
Use a damp paper towel to wipe the rims of the jars, then put a flat lid and ring on each jar, adjusting the ring so that it's just finger-tight.
Return the jars to the water in the canning pot, making sure the water covers the jars by at least 1 inch.
Bring to a boil, and boil for 5 minutes to process.
Remove the jars to a folded towel and do not disturb for 12 hours.
After 1 hour, check that the lids have sealed by pressing down on the center of each; if it can be pushed down, it hasn't sealed, and the jar should be refrigerated immediately.
Label the sealed jars and store.

Put ingredients in the Bosch bowl in order listed.
Turn Bosch on and knead on speed 1 for a total of 8 minutes.
Quickly add (after turning on) additional flour (1/2 C at a time) if needed for dough to pull away from side of the bowl, turning off Bosch each time you add flour.
It should only pull initially half way up the side of the bowl, and during the 5 minutes, it will completely pull away.
Turn oven on to 375 and oil your hands and counter well, spraying 4-5 loaf pans with cooking spray or oil.
Divide the dough between the loaf pans and let rise for approximately 30 to 45 minutes.
They will rise more in the oven.
Turn oven down to 350 and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove from pans and let cool on cooling racks, covering with a tea towel, before cutting (if you can wait!

Set your oven to 200 degrees.
Spray a large cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray, and set aside.
Also spray a large (very large works best) metal or ceramic mixing bowl with non-stick cooking spray.
Pour the popcorn into the mixing bowl you just sprayed, and put it in the oven to warm.
Warming the bowl and the popcorn up beforehand helps with getting an even coating with the caramel when stirring it into the popcorn later.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the molasses, corn syrup, brown sugar, and granulated sugar.
Once the mixture starts bubbling, set a timer and let it cook for 4 minutes, stirring occassionally.
Once the 4 minutes is up, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and baking soda.
The mixture will foam and lighten up.
Stir until blended.
Pull the mixing bowl with the popcorn out of the oven.
Slowly stir the caramel into the popcorn.
I find a rubber spatula works best for this.
Carefully keep stirring until the popcorn is evenly coated.
Do be careful, the caramel is really hot!
At this point, you can stir in any add-ins you might like, sprinkles, nuts, etc.
Pour onto the greased cookie sheet and spread out evenly.
Bake for 1 hour at 200 degrees, carefully stirring every 15 minutes.
Once done, pour back into a large mixing bowl.
The caramel popcorn will still be stightly tacky.
Stir the caramel corn for about 5 minutes or so while it cools, to break up large clumps.



Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Mix together the sour cream, light corn syrup, molasses, salt, rum (optional) and two cups of the granulated sugar.
Melt the remaining cup of granulated sugar in a heavy bottomed pot, stirring constantly until it is caramelized.
Pour the mixed ingredients into the melted sugar at first slowly, stirring rapidly, so that it mixes with the sugar.
Then pour the rest of the mix in.
Much steam will be released in this process, so it is advised to wear a cooking mitten on the hand that is used to stir.
Cook without stirring until the mixture reaches a temperature of 250 F (midway between the softball and hardball stage.)
To accurately measure the temperature, calibrate and adjust your thermometer for you elevation.
Place the thermometer in a pot of water and bring it to the boiling point.
Note the reading on your thermometer.
Apply the difference between the boiling point shown and the true boiling point of 112 F to the 250 F true praline temperature.
If, for example, the thermometer shows the water boiling at 202 F, then subtract 10 degrees from the praline temperature of 250 F to get the reading of 240 F at which the praline syrup is done.
Add the cleaned pecans all at once.
Fold and mix the pecans into the syrup until thoroughly mixed.
Drop by spoonfuls onto oiled parchment paper or onto an oiled marble surface.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.
Potato Ricer.
Electric Lefse Pan (or substitute electric griddle or nonstick griddle).
Lefse Stick (substitute long wooden handle of spoon or even better, an unused wooden paint can stirrer).
Grooved Lefse Rolling Pin (regular pin can work).
Canvas covering for your rolling pin is also desirable.
INSTRUCTIONS:.
Night before making lefse, peel, dice (1 inch pieces or so) and cook potatoes in boiling water until tender (about 20 minutes).
Drain and return to still warm cooking pot over just turned off burner to allow potatoes to let off any extra steam so they don't have extra water.
Rice potatoes with potato ricer over butter/margarine until you have added 8 cups riced.
Add sugar, salt, and vegetable oil.
Stir until everything is melted.
Store mixture overnight in cool spot covered with paper towel.
Next morning, rice the mixture again through your potato ricer into a large bowl.
Divide riced mixture into two batches.
Sift and mix one cup flour into one batch.
Place the other in refrigerator until later.
Divide the batch you have added the flour to into 1/4 C to 1/3 C patties (smaller amount is easier for beginner).
Keep two or three patties out for rolling.
Refrigerate the remaining patties on a cookie sheet (keeping them cool helps with rolling with as little flour as possible, the key to really thin lefse).
Heat your Electric Lefse Pan or if using griddle to medium heat.
Flour rolling pin and board (if possible cover them with canvas and then flour).
Roll each pattie as thin as possible, using flour as needed to prevent sticking, but as little as possible.
Turn over once when rolling, lightly flouring board again.
Using your lefse stick, place stick on left end of lefse.
Flip dough over stick and roll to right to roll up lefse on stick.
Place it on right side of Lefse pan or griddle and unroll.
Lefse will begin bubbling and lightly browning.
The more "bubbling " the more tender it will be.
Use stick again to turn over and cook other side.
Remove lightly browned round from lefse pan or skillet with lefse stick, fold round into quarters and let cool on paper towels.
Overlap each folded round slightly as you let cool to prevent edges from drying out.
Once finished with first batch, Mix one cup flour into remaining riced mix and repeat as above.
Let lefse cool completely before wrapping in plastic wrap and refrigerating or freezing in plastic bags.
Spread with butter, sprinkle with sugar, and warm slightly in microwave to eat in the traditional way.



in blender combine all ingredients, till smooth and thick.
Pour into 4 oz glasses, and sprinkle with shredded coconut as a garnish.



Start with whole skinless peanuts from an Asian grocery.
Theyre white and fat.
Sometimes theyve been boiled, sometimes theyre raw.
If you can find only peanuts with the skins on, youll need to rub the skins off after dry-roasting.
Place a heavy large skillet over medium heat.
Add about 1 cup peanuts and use a wooden spoon to move them around the pan frequently to prevent sticking and burned spots as they roast.
They will start to develop golden patches and become aromatic; if you notice any black patches on the nuts before they have turned light brown, remove the pan from the heat for a moment and lower the heat, then return the pan to the heat and continue.
Once the peanuts are golden brown in large patches all over, transfer them to a large cutting board and coarsely chop.
Or, let them cool, then transfer to a food processor and pulse briefly to coarsely chop; be careful not to overprocessyou do not want a paste.
Store, once completely cooled, in a well-sealed container in a cool place.
In Vietnam and Cambodia, chopped dry-roasted peanuts are often mixed with sugar to make a sweetened topping for desserts or sticky rice.



In a large bowl, combine pancake mix, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.
Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine milk and molasses, whisk until blended.
Add to dry ingredients, mix until larger lumps disappear (making sure not to over-mix).
Cook pancakes according to package directions and serve with your favorite syrup.



Combine the molasses, baking soda and boiling water.
Let it cool while you mix together the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl.
This flour mixture will have a crumb texture.
Set aside about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of this crumb mixture.
Combine the two main mixtures together in the largest of the two bowls.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes in a 13 x 9 pan that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.
Sprinkle the reserved crumb mixture on top of the cake and bake for about 15 minutes more, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.



Soak pecan halves in salted water for 1 hour (no longer no shorter).
Put in a colander and drain well.
Place pecan halves on a large foil covered baking sheet with rim.
Bake in a 250 degree oven for 1 hour or until pecans are desired doneness (get more crispy with time).
Stir and test twice during roasting because different pecans have different starting moisture levels.
No fat is needed to enhance the flavor.
Caryn's note: I have wanted to add some different spices to these to make them more savory or sweet, but every time I make these and don't do anything else I am so glad I didn't.



Preheat a small skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the whole spices and toast them, shaking the skillet every few seconds, until they start to crackle and turn reddish brown and the aroma is highly nutty-fragrant with citrus undertones, 1 to 3 minutes.
Immediately transfer the spices to a plate to cool.
(The longer they sit in the hot skillet, the more likely it is that they will burn, making them bitter and unpalatable.)
Once they are cool to the touch, place them in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, and grind until the texture resembles that of finely ground black pepper.
(If you dont allow the spices to cool, the ground blend will acquire unwanted moisture from the heat, making the final blend slightly cakey.)
The ground blend will be a deep reddish brown and the aromas will be sweet and complex, very different from those of the pre-toasted and post-toasted whole spices.
Store the masala in a tightly sealed container, away from excess light, heat, and humidity, for up to 2 months.
(In my opinion, refrigerating the blend adversely affects its flavors.)



In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together.
Then, using a pastry cutter or a pair of knives, a spoon, or your hands, cut the butter into the flour.
Basically, cut the butter and mix with flour to coat and separate the pieces.
Continue until you get pea sized pieces of butter.
It is important that the butter be cold for this process and not begin to melt.
If it starts to get a little mushy, you can slip it into the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm back up a bit before continuing.
Pour the milk in and mix gently with a spatula.
Do not knead, just gently mix.
(Kneading will produce gluten which will make the biscuit bread like instead of light and flaky.
).
Using your hands, form the dough into a ball once the milk has been evenly distributed through the dough.
You might need to use a kneading action to get it into a manageable shape and to remove some dough from the sides of your container, but try not to knead too much.
Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper or clean surface and roll out into a large sheet about 1/4 inch in thickness.
Use a cup or biscuit cutter to cut rounds out of the dough.
Do not twist the cup or cutter (unless you have already cut all the way through).
Twisting will result in uneven or failed rising.
Usually it's a good idea to press the top of the biscuit down a little or else you will get biscuits with rounded tops.
Now, biscuit placement is key to getting good rise out of the biscuits.
Place the biscuit dough circles into two 9" cake rounds or onto a half sheet pan.
Have the biscuits just touching.
This should give enough air between the biscuits to allow even heating, but not so much space that the biscuits spread out when they rise.
Bake in a 425F oven until golden (about 15 minutes).



Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Peel and cut carrots, squash and parsnips into fingers 1/4 inch square and about 2 inches long.
Toss vegetables together and place in a small roasting pan or gratin dish.

Bake for 15 minutes, then stir the vegetables.
Bake an additional 15 minutes or until tender.



Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a shallow 1 quart baking dish.
Whisk flour, baking powder, white sugar, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mix in the milk, oil, and vanilla extract.
Stir in nuts.
Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Mix brown sugar and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder together; sprinkle over batter in baking dish.
Pour the boiling water slowly over the top of the batter and topping.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.
The top of the cake will be set and the bottom will be soft.
Invert hot cake onto a platter to serve.



Stir all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture simmers.
Cover and cook until apricots soften, about 6 minutes; cool.

Close bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter.
Stir in the 1 teaspoon soy sauce and hot pepper sauce.
Turn off heat and reserve.
Remove the chicken wings from the marinade and pat dry.
Cook the wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well browned and no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes.
Place grilled wings in a large bowl.
Pour butter sauce over wings; toss to mix well.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Divide among 12 muffin cups; press into bottom and up the sides.
Cook until golden and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
Let cool.
Fill with jelly beans, speckled eggs or other candy eggs.



Shake all in an ice filled tumbler and swirl in an extra splash of grenadine into the glass for extra color and sweetness.
It tastes exactly like fruit punch.
Enjoy!



In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the 4 1/2 cups flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute.
Add the butter and mix just until it's a crumbly, sandy mixture.
The pieces of butter should still be visible.
In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together.
With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms.
Again, the bits of butter should be visible.
Turn the dough out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape it into 2 round, flat disks.
Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand.
Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes.
Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center.
If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour.
Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up.
Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than the pan.
If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; it's easily repaired.
Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim.
Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.
Leave the edges of the bottom crust hanging over the rim.
Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter.
Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper.
Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, then unroll it onto the sheet pan.



Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
Grind uncooked rice in a blender until grains are broken; add to butter, cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir coconut milk, water, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl to dissolve sugar; gradually add to rice, stirring constantly.
Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.



Place the cream and butter in a microwave-safe 1 qt glass measure and microwave, uncovered on high power just until boiling, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the sugars and whisk until dissolve.
Whisk in the remaining ingredients until completely blended.
Microwave uncovered on medium (50%) power for 1 minute.
Strain the sauce and serve hot.
Sauce can be reheated on medium power until heated through.



Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together flour, salt and cayenne pepper into a bowl, set aside.
In another bowl, add butter and cheddar cheese and mix until creamy.
Slowly beat in flour mixture, a scoop at a time, until blended.
Add cheese straw batter to plastic bag with corner cut out.
Put the batter into bag and squeeze onto cookie sheet, two rows of batter, or add another layer, whatever you like.
Bake for 12 minutes or until lightly browned.



Mix all ingredients in medium bowl.
Season with salt and pepper.
(Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.
Refrigerate.)



Place carrots into a jelly mold, or pretty serving dish, and gently spread out so the top is fairly even.
Pour jello over the carrots, and refridgerate til set.
Turn out onto serving dish, and serve with BBQ meats.



In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the cream cheese, butter and sugar.
Add the vanilla and mix to incorporate.
Add the flour and salt and mix until everything is combined.
Divide your dough into 4 equal pieces (the dough will be very sticky at this point but thats ok) wrap each one with some plastic wrap and pop them in the fridge for about 8 hours or overnight.
Take the dough out of the fridge about 45 minutes before youre ready to use it.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper, set them aside.
To make the filling, mix together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, walnuts and cinnamon, set aside.
Add the apricot preserves in a microwave safe bowl and pop it in the microwave for a few seconds just to loosen it up a bit.
Take each piece of dough, roll it out to a 9 circle on a well floured surface (if the dough cracks and breaks, gather it up, warm it with your hands and re-roll it) brush or spread some of the preserves over the surface of the dough and sprinkle some of the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top.
Lightly press the sugar filling into the dough using your hands, cut the circle into 12 little triangles and starting from the wider end, roll them up like little crescents.
Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling.
Place them seam side down on your baking sheet and brush the tops with some egg wash.
Before you bake them, pop them in the fridge for about 15 minutes so the dough can firm up a bit.
Bake them in your preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.



Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Saute ground beef until browned; drain.
Stir in corn and beans and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.



Cut the mozzarella curd into small pieces and place them in a Teflon pan.
Add the salt and nigella seeds.
Heat the cheese on low, stirring, until it is melted thoroughly and there are no lumps left.
Remove the cheese from the heat and drain off the excess water in a colander.
While the cheese is still very warm but cool enough to handle, pick it up in a large lump and poke a hole in the center with your fingers, so that the cheese resembles a large doughnut.
You will need to work very quickly at this point because the cheese cools down rapidly once it has been stretched.
Youll have about 3 minutes to stretch the cheese.
Grab it with both hands and stretch it so that it forms a large loop.
Stick your finger through each end of the loop, and very quickly start winding the two strands of the loop around each other, as if you were making a rope while winding.
Keep stretching the cheese gently, almost to the breaking point.
The more you stretch, the stringier the cheese will be.
When finished, you should have a length of cheese that resembles a thick rope or a tightly wrung-out dish cloth.
Twist the ends of the cheese in opposite directions and intertwine the rope into a braid.
Place one end through the loop of the other to lock it.
Set the cheese aside in the refrigerator or in a cool room for about an hour to dry thoroughly.
Wrap the cheese in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze it; it will keep for a week in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer.
To serve the cheese, open the braid, cut one loop, and pull the cheese apart into thin strands.
Serve with pita bread.



Combine the first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl.

1.
In a medium saucepot over medium-low heat, add your butter and brown sugar.
Cook, stirring occasionally until your butter has melted.
2.
Once butter has melted you will begin to see it rise to the surface.
Thats OK. Once the brown sugar melts, it will all incorporate.
Continue to simmer and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently (but not constantly) until the brown sugar has melted and the butter and sugar have incorporated fully together, about 6-7 minutes.
(If your caramel is bubbling too violently, turn your heat down to low.
You want a constant bubbling simmer.)
3.
Remove pan from heat and add your vanilla extract, salt and milk, stirring constantly.
Add the pan back to medium-low heat and bring back to a boil.
Next whisk in your ground cinnamon and cook, stirring constantly, one more minute.
4.
Remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly before adding it to cake layers, filling cupcakes, or pouring into jars.
** Store the unused sauce in the fridge, in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
It will almost solidify, when in the fridge.
To reheat and make it pourable, simply spoon out what you need and gently microwave, or warm it over super low heat on the stove in a non-stick pan.
Makes approximately 3 cups (enough for an 8 three-layer cake plus 2 dozen cupcakes ... with some left over.)

Heat the sugars, honey, water and salt in a large pot over a low-medium flame.
Use a pot that is larger than you would think necessary because when the mixture begins to boil it will foam up and increase in size.
Stir every five minutes or so.
Using a candy thermometer, continue to heat the mixture until it reaches a temperature of exactly 302 degrees Fahrenheit.
This is very important because this is the temperature at which sugar hardens into a rock-like state after it cools.
Pay close attention not to go very far above 302, otherwise you will burn the sugar.
It can take up to an hour for the mixture to reach that high of a temperature, so don't get too worried if 15 minutes go by and the thermometer is still at 175.
While the sugar mixture is boiling, place a sheet of parchment paper on top of a shallow pan, about 9 x 13 inches in width and length, and grease the parchment paper.
Set aside.
Once the sugar mixture reaches 302, immediately remove it from heat and stir in the butter, cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries until they're coated in the mixture.
Immediately pour the mixture onto the parchment paper and spread it out into a large rectangle using a rubber spatula.
Try to keep the surface relatively even and about 1 inch in height.
Place the pan in the refrigerator and allow the brittle to cool for one hour.
Once it has finished cooling, remove the sheet of brittle from the parchment paper and break the brittle into pieces using a meat tenderizer or clean hammer.

Spread evenly, then place top crust over filling.
Seal bottom and top crusts together.
Use a knife and make slits on the top crust to allow venting.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour, or till the top crust turns slightly brown and filling inside is properly done.
If not, lower the temperature of the oven and bake for a few more minutes.
The filling bubbling through the slits is a good sign that the pie is done.
During the last 5-10 minutes of baking, heat additional butter and brush the top crust to finish and achieve a nice brown color.
Note: This crust is wonderfully soft and easy to stretch and roll.
Any leftovers can be used with fruit fillings/cheeses, or wrapped in braids with pesto and garlic.

The berries are ripest when they have turned from red to black.
Since they ripen one by one, pick and store them in the refrigerator.
Once you collect enough, you can make the jam.
I had a lot of small, firm blackberries, so I put them in the blender for 5 seconds and then strained them through a strainer.
Even after doing that, they still had some seeds.
If that bothers you, use a cheesecloth to strain again.
Place the strained berries into a pot.
Add 40-50% the weight of the berries in sugar, and turn the heat on to low.
Bring it to a slow simmer and occasionally remove any scum that rises to the top.

Makes 2 medium pizzas.
1.
Put the bread flour in a large bowl, stirring in the yeast and salt.
2.
Stir in the water gradually until a soft (but not sticky) dough forms.
Start with a cup of the water, and add up to 1/3 cup more as needed.
3.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 3 minutes, adding flour if the dough starts sticking to your hands or to the surface.
By the end of the 3 minutes, the dough should be very soft.
4.
Sprinkle the bowl with flour, put the lump of dough back in, and sprinkle the top of the dough with flour as well.
Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit in a warm place for 2 hours.
5.
An hour before youre ready to bake, heat the oven to 500 degrees F with a pizza stone inside, on the lowest rack (close to the element).
You want the pizza stone to heat up gradually with the oven.
6.
When the dough is done rising, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter and divide it into 2 pieces.
Flatten each piece into a disc and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
7.
Cut 2 large pieces of parchment paper, and shape one pizza on each piece of paper, trying to avoid using the rolling pin to extend the dough (which will squash out the desirable air bubbles).
If you want a nice thick crust along the edges, leave extra thickness around the perimeter.
Note: folding the crust over doesnt work as well as simply leaving a thick edge.
8.
Add the toppings you wanttomato sauce, veggies, cheeseleaving the crust area clear so that it will puff up in the oven.
9.
Slide the parchment paper pizza onto the hot baking stone and bake for 10-14 minutes, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.
10.
Enjoy!

Add the shortening.
With a few quick swipes of the pastry blender, cut the shortening into large chunks and distribute throughout the bowl.
Continue to chop with the pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-size pieces.
Do not let the mixture soften and begin to clump; it must remain dry and powdery.
Drizzle 6 tablespoon ice water over the fat and flour mixture.
Cut with the blade side of the spatula until the mixture looks evenly moistened and begins to form small balls.
Press down on the dough with the flat side of the spatula.

Add the butter or oil and water, stirring vigorously until well combined; the dough may be stiff.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a greased flexible spatula.
Drizzle the dough top with about a teaspoon of melted butter or oil; use a pastry brush or your fingertips to spread it evenly over the dough.
Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at a room temperature of about 70 degrees or cooler for 12 to 18 hours.
For the second stage:.
Vigorously stir the dough until it deflates.
Generously coat a 9-by-5-inch or similar large (1 3/4- to 2-quart) loaf pan with nonstick cooking oil spray.
Turn out the dough into the pan.

Sourdough starters can be purchased commercially or possibly they can be started on your own.
Your own might be more fun.
One c. of water is mixed with 1 Tbsp.
sugar, 1 c. flour, and 4 Tbsp.
commercial buttermilk.
Mix all of this together and place it in a glass or possibly stainless-steel bowl.
Don't use aluminum.
Cover this with a towel and allow to stand in a hot place for a few days, or possibly till it has begun to ferment and has a wonderful sour smell.
You might keep this on the top of the water heater or possibly in your oven and leave the light on all the time.
The starter should be the consistency of pancake batter and it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator.
Use this as your starter in any of the recipes which follow.
The old-timers claim which you can get a sourdough starter going by just mixing flour and water together and allowing it to sit in a hot place for several days.
This may work, but it is not terribly reliable.
HINT: ON STORING SOURDOUGH STARTER.
When storing sourdough starter in the refrigerator, remember which it should be kept at around 42 .
If it is too cool, it will take a long time to come around again, to come back to life.
Your refrigerator is probably colder than this, so perhaps you may want to store the starter in a very cold place.



Combine all ingredients in a large sauce pot.
Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer about 1 hour or until thick.
Stir frequently as mixture thickens to prevent sticking.
Pour hot into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space.
Adjust caps.
Process 30 minutes in boiling water bath.



In mixing bowl, mix together melted butter and milk.
Add Flour, Baking Powder, Sugar and Salt.
Mix together until just mixed.
Do not over mix this.
Drop by tablespoon onto parchment lined or greased baking sheet.
Bake in a 450 Degree preheated oven for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
This recipe makes about 8 good size bisquits.



Preheat oven at 350 degrees F. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.
Spread mixture on a well sprayed cookie sheet and bake for about ten minutes.
Flip over the pieces as well as you can and bake for another five minutes, or until everything is crispy.
Dont worry if some of it sticks together, it easily breaks apart.
Allow to cool before tasting, it will be extremely hot.



Heat the olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
Add the sausage, raise the heat to medium, and saute until it is a nice brown colour all over - 12 to 15 minutes.
Sere immediately on a small oval plate.
NOTE: If you prefer, the sausage can be grilled whole over high heat, 3 inches from the heat source, for about 12 minutes.
Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing it into 3 inch lengths.



Mixing and Storing the Dough:.
Note: If measuring flour rather than weighing, don't press down into the flour as you scoop it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups, By gently scooping up flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula.you willl get a more accurate measurement.
In large plastic storage container (with lid) mix together the flour, yeast, sugar and salt.
Add all the water and olive oil at once and mix with a wooden spoon.
If mixing becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, reach into the mixing bowl with very wet hands and press the mixture together.
Note: kneading isn't necessary.
When everything is uniformly moist without dry patches your mixing is complete.
This should take only a few minutes.
The dough will be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.
Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well on the container.
Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse, or at least flattens on the top, about 2 hours, depending on the room's temperature and the initial water temperature.
Longer rising times, up to about 5 hours, will not harm the result.
You can use a portion of the dough anytime after this period.
Fully refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature.
So the first time you try this method, it's best to refrigerate the dough overnight, or at least 3 hours, before shaping a loaf.
The breads flavor improves with the retardation, so suggest you wait at least 24 hours before baking the first loaf!
Dough may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 12 days.

Brushing biscuits with milk before baking will produce a pretty brown top.
Makes 10.



In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and sugar together (if using honey or agave nectar, dissolve it in the lukewarm water instead).
Stir the yeast into the lukewarm water, whisk to dissolve the yeast, then stir in the oil.
Add the water mixture to the flour mixture.
If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute.
If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute.
The dough should be wet and coarse.
Let the dough sit for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour.
Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium-low speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 2 minutes.
The dough will firm up slightly and become smoother.
If its very stiff, add a little more water, 1 teaspoon at a time.
The dough should be very supple and slightly sticky.
Continue to mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed, or to mix by hand, for 4 minutes more, increasing the speed to medium-high or stirring more vigorously for the final 20 seconds to develop and organize the gluten.
The dough will still be slightly sticky but will also feel stronger and more elastic.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface with a wet bowl scraper.
With wet or oiled hands, reach under one end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough.
Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.
The dough should be slightly firmer, though still very soft and fragile.
Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Repeat this entire process three more times, completing all repetitions within 40 minutes.
After the final stretch and fold, immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate the dough overnight or for up to 4 days.
The dough will rise to about double, and possibly triple, its original size within 8 to 12 hours in the refrigerator.
(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)
Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 3 hours before you plan to bake.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two equal pieces for loaves or small pieces for rolls.
Shape the cold dough into freestanding loaves (see page 20) or rolls (see page 25).
You can use bannetons, couches, or the back of a sheet pan lined with parchment paper to proof the bread.
Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap, then let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, until increased to 1 1/2 times its original size.
Preheat the oven to 500F (260C) and prepare it for hearth baking (see page 30).
Uncover the dough 15 minutes before baking and score it with a sharp serrated knife or razor blade (scoring rolls is optional).
Transfer the dough to the oven, pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, and lower the oven temperature to 425F (218C).
Bake loaves for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan; rotate rolls after 10 minutes.
The total baking time is 35 to 45 minutes for loaves, and only 20 to 22 minutes for rolls.
The bread is done when the top and sides are a deep, rich brown; the loaf sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom; and the internal temperature is above 195F (91C) in the center.
For a crisper crust, leave the bread in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes after you turn off the oven.
Cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes for rolls and 45 minutes for loaves before slicing or serving.

Make sure to cut out any mushy or brown spots.
Cut pears how you prefer them (halves, slices, pieces, etc.)
The pears may darken a little while standing; thats okay, they lighten back up when cooked.
Heat water and sugar on the stove.
Boil the solution for a couple of minutes and then add the pears.
Boil the pears for 5 minutes.
Use a slotted spoon and funnel and put cooked pears into jars (leaving the liquid in the pan).
Make sure to leave a 1/2 inch of space at the top of the jar.
Once you have the pears in the jars, pour the solution in the jars making sure to leave that 1/2 inch of space at the top.
Put on the lids and rings.
Hand tighten the rings.
Place in a canning pot and cover with water, making sure there is at least an inch of water above the jars.

Preheat oven to 450 Fahrenheit.
Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Add the oil and enough water to combine everything.
Stir first than mix by hand if necessary, it doesnt have to be perfect.
The less mixing the better, you dont want to work the gluten in the flour or it will be hard to shape the dough.
I use a cookie sheet with edges but any pan will do.
I also use parchment paper to line the pan, but flour or cornmeal work also.
By flattening the dough on the parchment lined cookie sheet I dont have to add extra flour or try to move the crust.
Flatten dough to desired shape, working from the middle out.
I use a rectangular shape to fill a small cookie sheet or jelly roll pan.
Press with fingers or knuckles to move the dough outward, if it gets to thin or tears just push some dough back to fill the area.

Bake for 10-12 minutes.
What Other Variations Can I Try?.
Add more herbs to the crust.
Use different flours, half white half wheat is a favorite at my house.
Use a variety of toppings.
How Can I Make This Healthier?.
Use wheat flour, it is much more nutritious than white all purpose.
Half white, half wheat is a great way to start.
Add more veggies to the sauce and toppings.
Consider a low fat cheese.
How to Freeze.
I highly recommend shaping this no yeast pizza dough before freezing.
That way you dont have to let it thaw.
A jelly roll pan with it's high sides is perfect because the topping won't spill into your oven.
Cover it in tin foil for freezer storage.
Also since a piece of dough the size of a cookie sheet is a bit bulky in the freezer sometimes I freeze the dough in individual portions.
Six to eight inch round pieces, you can get four to six pieces out of one recipe depending how flat you like your crust.
Wrap well.
I slip plastic wrap between the pieces to keep them from freezing to each other and put them all in a plastic freezer bag.
Store for up to 3 months.
For longer storage wrap separately and seal well.
Label with the date.
Add toppings before or after freezing.
Baked pizza can also be frozen, thaw it in the microwave for a fast snack.
How to Thaw.
Thawing this no yeast pizza dough is optional, it can be cooked from frozen.
I usually pull it from the freezer as I turn on the oven to preheat to 450 Fahrenheit.
In the 10 minutes it takes the oven to warm up the double is mostly thawed.
Bake pizza for 10-12 minutes at 450 Fahrenheit, with a larger or thicker crust you might want to let it cook a few minutes more.
Make sure to dust the pan with cornmeal or line with parchment so the crust does not stick.

When the vinegar has dried, pour coconut oil into your hair, making sure you get complete coverage.
Cover your hair with a shower cap or hair wrap & leave it in for the whole day, as it will take a few hours for the coconut oil to smother & kill the lice.
Comb your hair to get as many of the eggs & lice out as possible and then shampoo as normal.
You only have to do this once, it really works & no chemicals!
Note from, K8recipe -- I noticed this and thought I should share some information that, after exhaustive research, helped me.
My foster daughter, now my own through adoption, .
.
.
ALWAYS came home infested.
After much research, I discovered Tea Tree Oil.
That was 6 years ago.
.
.
.
but she also is always immune to any outbreaks at school as well.
The tea tree oil (TTO) kills the Louse Central Nervous System (CNS) so they cannot move around and reproduce.
Of course, they also die because they cannot feed.
Tea tree oil also acts as a repellent because Lice cannot stand it.
Therefore, if your child has lice: Apply freely to the scalp and around ears and neck, wherever lice are prominant.
Soak the hair in TTO and cover with a cap and sleep on it.
Put a towel down on the pillowcase or around their area bcz the oil will stain.
As a preventative, we add just a few drops to her shampoo to repel and discourage those nasty little blood suckers.
I swear by this and I feel the need to share anytime I can.
I struggled SO much, was overcome with frustration and at my wits and when I discovered this.
TTO can be found in WALMART vitamin/mineral aisle or at any health food store.
Please pass this on as I'm sure you know someone who could use this info.
Kate.



1.
First, you will need to make your bone broth (or buy broth from the store).
I shamelessly cheat on this task, as, traditionally, it should simmer for 24 hours!
I dont know about you, but I definitely dont have that kind of time, and Im not leaving my stove-top on while Im sleeping.
What I do is throw all of the bones from a leftover turkey into a large stockpot, fill it 2 inches from the top with water, and then simmer it for 2-3 hours (be sure not to boil or you will get cloudy broth), adding water as needed if the water level gets low.
I then turn off the burner, let it come to room temperature, and plop it into the fridge with the lid on, bones still in, for 24-36 hours.
When Im ready to use the broth it is gelatinous, so I heat it on the stove until it becomes liquid again and then strain the juices through a fine mesh colander, removing the bones.
Viola!
Its ready to use!
2.
Add the celery and onions into the bottom of a large stock pot with the butter.
Heat for approximately 3 minutes on medium heat.
I dont allow the vegetables to cook too much, because I want them to retain their integrity and add texture to the soup.
3.
Pour the flour into the pot and mix with the buttery vegetable mixture, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes, allowing the flour to have some time to cook.
4.
Begin adding the broth, 1 cup at a time for the first 4 cups.
After adding each cup, stir frequently until well combined with the flour before adding the next cup.
After you have done this with the first 4 cups, you can turn the burner to medium-high heat, add the remainder of the broth and the water, and then bring it to a gentle boil.
5.
Add the rice and carrots to the pot and when the soup begins to boil turn the heat to medium-low.
Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the carrots are fork-tender.
6.
Stir in the turkey, parsley, salt, and pepper to taste, and then your soup is ready to serve.



Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Combine rice and water; let stand 5 minutes.

Pour the batter into two 4x 8-inch loaf pans that have been sprayed with non-stick spray.
Bake for about 45 minute until golden and springy to the touch.
Remove from the pans and cool on a wire rack.
The cooler the bread, the easier it is to slice really thin.
You can leave it until the next day or pop it in the freezer.
Slice the loaves as thin as you can and place the slices in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Try slicing and baking one loaf and popping the other in the freezer for later.
Reduce the oven heat to 300F and bake them for about 15 minutes then flip them over and bake for another 10 minutes, until crisp and deep golden.
Try not to eat them all at once!

Put all the ingredients in a bread machine and knead until the gluten develops.
I took it out of the machine once the kneading was done and rounded off the dough before the 1st rising.
Check with a finger to see if it has risen enough (a hole made floured finger should not bounce back).
Take the dough out and deflate.
Divide into 2 to 3 portions, and round off each piece so that the surface is taut and smooth and pinch the seams closed.
Cover with plastic wrap and rest for 10 minutes.
When the dough has rested, deflate it again and roll out about 20 to 25 cm square.
Fold into thirds lengthwise, roll up from the near side, and pinch the rolled end closed.
Put the dough pieces in an oiled bread pan.
Cover with plastic wrap and use your oven's bread-rising setting to let the dough rise for 40 to 50 minutes at 30-40C (2nd rising).
If you want a square loaf let the dough rest to about 80% of the height of the pan.
If you want a loaf with a rounded top, let it rise until it's risen a bit higher than the rim.
Preheat the oven to 180C.
When the oven has heated up, bake the bread for 30 minutes at 180C and it's done.
If it looks like the top is browning too fast, cover with a piece of foil.
As soon as it comes out of the oven, drop the bread pan and all from about a 30 cm height to push out the steam.
Take the loaf out of the pan.
Dense and bouncy and yet light and fluffy.
The result is a bread with a lasting moist, tender texture!
This one is baked in a square shokupan pan.
I turned this into sandwiches for an outing.
Since the bread stays moist and soft, it was great even after some time had passed.
This is a version with bacon and melting type cheese rolled into the dough.
The version in the top photo was made with my own homemade started.
I used 150 g of starter and 220 ml of water.
When the bread has cooled down completely, I slice it into pieces and keep it in bags.
It's moist and soft the next day.

Make the sponge.
In a mixer bowl or other large bowl, combine the flour, water, honey, and instant yeast.
Whisk until very smooth, to incorporate air, about 2 minutes.
The sponge will be the consistency of a thick batter, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.
Make the flour mixture and add to the sponge.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast.
Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature.
(During this time, the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in places: this is fine).
Mix the dough.
HAND METHOD.
Add the salt and butter to the bowl and, with a wooden spoon or with your hand, stir until all the flour is moistened.
Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to keep the dough from sticking.
Use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it.
At this point, it will be very sticky.
Cover it with an inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.
(This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with).
Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic.
It should still be tacky enough to cling slightly to your fingers a little.
If the dough is still very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra.
Shape the dough and let it rise.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half.
Shape each piece into a loaf; the exact size is not important at this point.
(A long side of the dough should be facing toward you).
Dimple the dough with your fingers to deflate any large bubbles.
Fold over the right side of the dough to a little past the center.
Fold over hte left side of the dough to overlap it slightly.
Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to seal the dough.
(If you have a lot of experiance shaping, you may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees- a quarter turn).
Starting at the top end of the dough, roll it over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the outer skin.
As you roll and press, the dough will become wider.
If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together on top of the dough and, rolling back and fourth, gradually work your way towards the ends, gently stretching the dough.
For the most even shape, it is important to keep a tight skin on the surface of the dough and not to tear it.
If you want the edges of the loaf to be smooth, tuck the sides under.
Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans; the dough will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans.
Cover them with a large container, or cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until the center is about 1 inch above the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
When the dough is pressed with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill inches.
Preheat the oven.
Preheat the oven to 350F 45 minutes before baking.
Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or a baking sheet on it, and a cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the floor of the oven, before preheating.

Make a cheesecloth bag that's 4 layers thick, and about 12" long by 6 1/2 " wide.
The bottom 8" or so should taper to a point.
Place the cottage cheese into a colander, over a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place a weight on top.
Let it drain for 2 - 3 hours.
Using an electric mixer, mix all the ingredients until they're well blended.
Place the cheesecloth bag in a large bowl, with the seems facing out.
Pack the mixture in the bag, to about 4" from the top of the cheesecloth.
Twist the top, and tie it being careful not to get it so tight that you're forcing the cheese out of the pores of the bag.
Cover a sheet pan with plastic, then place the filled cheese bag on top.
Place the bag so that the seem is in the center of the back, and front, it should almost look like a heart.
One end of this sheet pan should be elevated to permit the cheese to drain.
You can use either a bowl , or 2 coffee cups to do this.
Place a bowl underneath the bottom of the cheese, to catch the liquid that will drain out.
Cover the cheese with another piece of plastic wrap, and set another sheet pan on top.
Carefully place a weight on top of the top pan.
But, be careful because the cheese is real soft and the top pan will want to slide off once the weight is on it.
Store in a cool place, or in your refrigerator for 3 days, being sure to check it so that the weight doesn't fall off.
My Mom used to let this rest in the basement, because it was nice and cool, and she used a Belgian Brick that we would have to check now and then to insure that it didn't fall off.
When the cheese has dried out, cut off the cheesecloth bag with scissors, carefully so as not to break up the cheese.
The cheese should be real firm to the touch.
Place it flat on a platter, and store in your refrigerator until Easter morning.
If you haven't gotten enough moisture out of the cheese, you will have a cheese that won't stay together.
You can start this process a full week before Easter.

In a saucepan over medium high heat, add the strawberries and the sugar.
With a potato masher or mallet, smash and stir the strawberries until well macerated and combined with the sugar.
Allow the mixture to come to a boil, stirring and mashing until all the strawberries have broken down, about 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and allow to cool.
(If you want to strain the pulp and seeds, do so now.
I didnt strain.)
Place the strawberry mixture in the fridge until completely cool, about 2 hours.
At the same time, freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker.
Place mixture in the frozen bowl of your ice cream maker, add the beer, and churn it until firm (according to manufacturers instructions).
Place in a freezer safe container and chill until ready to serve.
*Note: I used a KitchenAid ice cream maker and this mixture needed an additional 3 hours of freezer time after processing until it firmed to the right consistency.
*If you dont have an ice cream maker, once the mixture has cooled in the fridge for 2 hours, add the beer, stir, and then transfer to a freezer safe bowl and freeze without agitating.
Sorbet consistency will vary with this method.
(Yield about 3 cups.)

Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides.
Coat the foil with 1 tablespoon of the butter.
Set aside.
In a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat, cook the superfine sugar, brown sugar, molasses, corn syrup, cream, salt, cream of tartar, and espresso until the sugar is dissolved (about 5 minutes), stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon or heatproof spatula.
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then brush down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in warm water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chocolate in 3 to 4 batches until completely melted and smooth.
Return the pan to medium heat.
Place a sugar thermometer in the pan and cook the mixture without stirring until it registers 238F on the thermometer (about 20 minutes).
Remove the pan from the heat, remove the thermometer from the pan, and place the thermometer in warm water to cool.
Immediately blend in the vanilla, the spices, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
Sprinkle a marble board or the back of a baking sheet with cold water and immediately pour the hot mixture onto the marble.
Do not scrape out the bottom of the pan.
Let the mixture cool on the marble until it registers 110F on the thermometer (about 5 minutes).
If using a baking sheet instead of the marble, the cooling time will be about 15 minutes.
Beat the fudge using one of the following three methods: With a 5-inch-wide flexible-blade scraper, transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, and with the paddle attachment, beat the mixture until it thickens and loses its shine (5 to 10 minutes).
Or transfer the mixture to a 2-quart mixing bowl and beat the mixture with a long-handled wooden spoon until it thickens and loses its shine (10 to 15 minutes).
Or spread the mixture into a large rectangle on the marble board, then use the 5-inch-wide flexible-blade scraper to gather the mixture back to the center of the marble, folding in the edges.
Repeat this process until the mixture begins to thicken and lose its shine (5 to 10 minutes).
Turn the fudge into the prepared pan.
Use your fingertips to even the top and to press the fudge into the corners of the pan.
Place the pan of fudge on a cooling rack and let it set completely at room temperature (1 to 2 hours).
Remove the fudge from the pan by lifting out the aluminum foil.
Invert the fudge onto cutting board, peel the foil off the back of the fudge, and reinvert the fudge.
With a large chefs knife, cut the fudge evenly into 1-inch squares.
Between layers of waxed paper in a tightly covered container, the fudge will keep for 10 days at room temperature or 1 month in the refrigerator.
The fudge is best served at room temperature.



Combine flours and baking powder in a bowl.
Add club soda plus about 4 cups water.
Mix into a smooth, fairly thin batter.
Heat a large, non-stick skillet.
When a drop of water bounces on the pan's surface, dip enough batter from the bowl to cover the bottom of the skillet, and pour it in quickly, all at once.
Swirl the pan so that the entire bottom is evenly coated, then set it back on the heat.
When the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the surface, remove the injera.
It should be cooked only on one side, and not too browned.
If your first one is a little pasty and undercooked, you may need to cook a little longer or to make the next one thinner.
But, as with French crepes, be careful not to cook them too long, or you'll have a crisp bread that may be tasty but won't fold around bits of stew.
Stack the injera one on top of the other as you cook, covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out.

Put aside.
Spoon Cocoa powder into a small plastic tub.
(A cleaned, used individual yoghurt tub is ideal - plastic is good because it doesn't warm the yoghurt like pottery or glass would.
).
Add the granulated sweetener and mix it well with the cocoa.
Add the vanilla flavouring and a small 3/4 teaspoon or so of the yoghurt.
Using teaspoon mix well until all the cocoa is mixed in and it forms a very thick paste.
If necessary add a little more yoghurt.
Should only take a few seconds.
Add a little more of the yoghurt - a teaspoon or two and mix that in well.
Then add the rest of the yoghurt and stir it well.
Add the grated chocolate and stir into the yoghurt.
DEVOUR!
Note: I kept the sweetness on the light side because it's easy to add more.
I actually added another 1/2 tsp sweetener but it kind of depends how heaped you make those teaspoons - I don't !
If you find it's already a bit too sweet then you can add a little more yoghurt.
This would stand the addition of some preserved cherries or other fruit such as small pieces of orange, banana, butterscotch or toffee chips and even a little kirschwasser, rum or Baileys if you're feeling indulgent.
If you're feeling really indulgent you could add cherries, liqueur and top with whipped cream, then sprinkle some grated chocolate or candied citrus fruit or zest for presentation.
Can easily be prepared in larger volumes and chilled.
UPDATE:.
I did make it again later - and yes it is absolutely delicious with small pieces of chopped up ripe banana :).



To make a basic roux start by measuring, by weight, the amounts of fat and flour desired.
It's a one to one ratio (e. g. 4 ounces of fat and 4 ounces of flour equal 8 ounces of roux).
Butter is the most commonly used form of fat.
Melt the butter over medium heat, careful not to start browning it, then slowly add the flour to the butter, whisking constantly.
Within 2 to 3 minutes the roux will have a consistency of a cake frosting.
Both fat and flour have various levels of moisture content and the possible choices of fat and flour that can be used are many.
For example, butter contains a small amount of water.
However, bacon fat, which has been perfectly rendered, contains no water.
Within these variables there are varying levels of consistencies.
If your roux is too thin, add a small amount of flour.
If it is too thick, add a small amount of fat to thin it out.
When cooking with a roux, be sure to add only cool liquids or ingredients to a hot roux, or vice versa.
As you incorporate the liquid into your roux, be sure to whisk frequently and add the ingredients slowly.
Then heat the entire mixture until it comes to a simmer.
This process will keep the roux from creating lumps.
Once all of the liquid has been added to the roux, cook the sauce or soup for at least 20 minutes, otherwise your finished product may have a granular or gummy texture.



In a big bow combine, flours, baking powder, salt and spices.
In another bowl combine oil, honey or agave syrup and enough milk to make 1/3 cup.
Then add sugars and vanilla bean paste or extract.
Stir to combine.
Add the wet to the dry ingredients and knead into a smooth, soft dough.
If it's too sticky, add a tbs of flour at a time until you can handle the dough well.
Roll out thinly (to about 2 mm/0.07 inch) and cut out desired shapes.
I used a cookie cutter of about 6 cm/2.5 inches in diameter.

Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
Enjoy!

Remove from heat.
Place apricot mixture in a blender.
Process until you get a thick yummy sticky mixture; adding a little water to process, as and when necessary.
Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
Pour 5 cups chilled water in a pitcher.
Now, take a large sieve over the pitcher and add the sticky apricot mixture, slowly over it; and keep stirring while you do so.
You will see the apricot mixture's liquidy content trickle down into the pitcher and the thick sticky part remain in the sieve.
Empty the thick sticky part into a bowl and keep aside.
You can use this as a topping over cooked white rice (steaming hot rice), or you can use this as a marinade over chicken, or as a dip, or as a topping over chicken salad, or even on a pizza- use your imagination!
Stir the apricot sherbet that's in the pitcher very gently; careful that it shouldn't spill, or you'll have alot of stickiness in the kitchen to clean up and nobody likes that.
Close the lid of the pitcher.
Carefully, put the pitcher in the refrigerator.

Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella.
Too much cheese will create a soggy pizza.
Slide pizza carefully onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through (if you can).
Remove pizza and place on wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
TOPPING TIPS: We like our Thin-Crust Pizza simply dressed with tomato sauce and handfuls of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, but additional toppings are always an option--provided they're prepared correctly and added judiciously.
(An overloaded pie will bake up soggy.)
Here are a few guidelines for how to handle different types of toppings:.
HEARTY VEGETABLES Aim for a maximum of 6 ounces per pie, spread out in a single layer.
Vegetables such as onions, peppers, and mushrooms should be thinly sliced and lightly sauteed (or microwaved for a minute or two along with a little olive oil) before using.
DELICATE VEGETABLES AND HERBS Leafy greens and herbs like spinach and basil are best placed beneath the cheese to protect them or added raw to the fully cooked pizza.
MEATS Proteins (no more than 4 ounces per pie) should be precooked and drained to remove excess fat.
We like to poach meats like sausage (broken up into 1/2-inch chunks), pepperoni, or ground beef for 4 to 5 minutes in a wide skillet along with 1/4 cup of water, which helps to render the fat while keeping the meat moist.
NOTE as with all breads, the ratio of wet to dry is critical and more accurately measured by weight).
Time does not include resting times.

Just before baking, dust the loaf with flour.
With sharp kitchen scissors, cut from the top, at a 45-degree angle into the dough, stopping a quarter inch from the bottom.
Make another identical cut about 3 inches down the loaf.
Fold each cut piece over to one side, and repeat cutting, alternating sides each time to replicate a stalk of wheat (see photo).
Slide the loaf directly onto the hot stone (baking dishes, or cookie sheet).
Pour 1 cup hot tap water into the broiler pan and quickly close the oven door.
Bake 20-25 minutes, until deeply browned and firm.
NOTE: Use 7 cups all-purpose flour if you don't have bread flour.
You will get 3-4, 1-pound loaves out of this recipe.

Repeat this a couple more times as the mixture becomes harder and harder, about 4 times in total.
Once you process it for the last time, transfer it to a freezer container you would like to store it in, covered, and keep frozen.
Let the mixture become hard again before serving (which will be 2-3 hours after you`re started making it), but keep in mind that it`s best eaten the next day as it`s had the time to really settle.
Enjoy!
EXTRA TIPS: I use a 500g container of Liberte`s thick Mediterranean coconut yogurt, which is kind of like greek yogurt, but it`s high in fat due to the coconut.
*****You can still make this without a food processor and just a spatula, but it will be a bit less creamy.
Just take out the mixture as described above but, instead of using a food processor, use a spatula of some sort and beat the mixture until it`s well mixed and soft again, and continue until it`s done.
*****You can get coconut oil for cheap at Asian and Indian grocery stores - Health food stores charge a lot more for theirs.
*****Please keep in mind that the amount of time it takes to make this recipe depends on how cold your freezer is, how big your plastic container is that you harden your mixture in between processing, and how often you process it in your food processor.
It will take at least 3 hours before it`s ready to serve and eat, but longer is better.

Note:.
Change the food at least every three to five days with a new batch to keep it fresh.
Remember don't use food coloring.
Check the bird feeder regularly and every time you change the food to see if any gray mold has formed inside the feeder base, or, any ants have crawled inside to get at the sugar water.
If you see any take the feeder down and throw the bird food away.
It's not good for the birds to drink this.

Add in 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine, 1 egg, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup molasses.
Beat on low speed with an electric mixer until the batter comes together.
Gradually add in 1 cup boiling water; stir just until combined.
Pour batter into baking dish and bake in a 350 oven for 35 minutes or until pick comes out clean.
Cool and serve with whipped cream.



Pour the yeast into the bowl of a standing electric mixer, if youre using one, or otherwise just put it in a big bowl.
Pour 1/4 cup of the warm water over the yeast, and let sit until dissolved and bubbly.
Add the rest of the water, the butter or oil, the syrup, all the wholewheat flour, and 2 cups of the white flour, as well as the wheat germ, the seeds, and the salt.
Mix well, and knead in the mixer or turn out and knead by hand, adding as much of the remaining white flour as the dough wants to absorb.
Even if you knead in the mixer, turn out the dough at the end and knead it it briefly by hand, to get the feel of it.
This will be a dense, heavy dough, but dont worryit will rise.
Butter or oil the mixing bowl, and return the dough to it.
Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume.
Punch down and divide the dough in half.
Butter thoroughly two 8- or 9-inch bread pans.
Shape each piece into a loaf: first pat it into an oval the length of your bread pan, then with your hands stretch and ease the long sides under and pinch the seams together on the bottom side.
Place each loaf in a bread pan seam side down.
Cover the pans loosely with a kitchen towel, and let rise again until the dough has begun to swell over the top of the pans.
Bake in a preheated 350 oven for 45 minutes.
Turn the loaves out onto a rack to cool before slicing.
A loaf of this bread, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, will keep through the week stored in the refrigerator.
I usually freeze the second loaf, cutting it in half or in thirds first and wrapping each separately.
Or I give the second loaf to a bread-loving friend.



Dissolve the yeast in water.

I know I put specific ingredient quantities on the list but this recipe, like most cooking, is about ratios and personal taste: 2 parts cottage cheese to 1 part mayo, salt, pepper, lemon juice, onion salt, and chives (or green onions) to taste.
Mix well and store in the fridge.
We usually serve it as a cold dip for fresh veggies but this also makes a great filling for pierogi.
Grandma used to actually chop up turnips, radishes and onions and mix it into the Gzika and eat it with a spoon.
But then again, she also liked lard on pumpernickle bread or a healthy serving of head cheese.
Hmm, that was probably an overshare, but you might as well get used to that.

Place the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt together into a medium bowl and whisk to combine, set aside until needed.
Place the butter and sugars into a large bowl and beat together until light and creamy, remember you are not making a cake so it doesnt need to be fluffy just well combined and light and creamy.
Add the flour mixture and with the mixer on low speed mix together until the mixture is sandy.
Sable is French for sandy and describes both the texture of the final cookie and this stage of the baking process.
If you mix until you have a uniform dough the texture of the final cookie will be a bit tougher and they wont melt in the mouth.
Add the chocolate and mix to combine.
Tip the mixture onto the worksurface and very gently knead to bring together.
Divide the dough in half and roll into logs, about 4cm inches in diameter.
Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate.
At this point I will normally freeze half of the dough ready to make cookies when the mood strikes.
Chill the dough for a few hours until firm.
Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan and line two baking trays with parchment paper.
Using a thin sharp knife cut the log into cookies, about 1cm thick but dont worry if the cookies crumble just press them gently back together.
Place onto the prepared baking trays and bake for 10-12 minutes or until spread and lightly set around the edges but still looks undercooked in the middle.
Allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
Stored in a sealed container these cookies will keep perfectly for a few days but trust me they will never last that long.

Combine yeast and 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl and let yeast dissolve.
Add salt, the rest of the water and a splash of olive oil.
Add the flour one cup at a time, stirring in between additions.
The dough will gradually stiffen and pull away from the sides of the bowl.
Once all of the flour has been added and the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes until it turns smooth and springy to the touch.
Wash out and butter the bowl you just used to mix the dough.
Place the dough back inside it and cover with a piece of plastic wrap.
Set it in a warm place and allow dough to rise until doubled in size.
Depending on the warmth of your kitchen it will take between 1-2 hours to rise.
Once the dough is done rising, take it out of the bowl, punch it down and cut the dough into two equal halves.
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Now its time to shape the loaves.
I generally flatten the dough with a rolling pin till its relatively even and then fold the long edges into each other.
Flip it over so the smooth side is on top.
Place the loaves on a baking sheet, slash the tops of the loaves with a knife several times and spray with a fine mist of water.
Place in a 350 F oven and bake for 40 minutes.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Start cooking bacon in pan.
While bacon cooks, mix flour, baking powder, salt, then add water and mix.

Place in a 3 1/2 quart or larger bean pot or casserole dish, or in two smaller pots.
Simmer in preheated oven at 250 5-6 hrs or until the beans are tender.



Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Spray a 13 x 9 dish with nonstick spray.
Halve or chop the potatoes in thirds so they are roughly the same size and place in the baking dish.
Drizzle with olive oil and season with the salt, pepper, and rosemary.

Tip the shredded coconut into your blender and blitz for between 5 - 20 minutes depending on your machine, scraping down the sides as required until the coconut turns into coconut butter
It's that easy!
Store in a lidded container at room temperature.
It is solid in it's natural state and doesn't require chilling
Use in cakes, desserts, as a nut spread for sandwiches or rice cakes or melt and drizzle over fruit for a tasty treat!
You'll need at least 400g / 5 cups to form butter.
Any less and the mixture may not reach the blades of your machine.
However much coconut you use, this recipe will yield half as much butter
FYI, making coconut milk is much the same.
Soak the shredded coconut in twice as much it's volume warm water in a blender, then blitz until creamy.
Strain through a muslin cloth and ta-da, homemade coconut milk.
Using less water makes thicker milk/cream
Keep the pulp leftover, spread it on a lined baking tray and bake on a low heat until touch dry.
Jar it and label it 'coconut flour' ;)
This will make enough coconut butter to fill a pint/ 450g jar



Place the pork, salt pork, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix with your hands to distribute the seasonings evenly.

Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.
Reheat covered in saucepot, stirring occasionally, until hot, 20 minutes.
).
To serve: ladle soup into bowls and garnish each bowl with a dollop of yogurt.
If you like yours a little more tangy, you can swirl in an extra dollop of yogurt.
Another time you might like to try this soup substituting 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves for the dillweed.



Place the salt in a large pot of water and bring to a boil; add fettuccine and cook according to package directions for al dente; during the last 3 minutes of cooking, add the broccoli.

Add rice and water to VERY large pan with vented lid.
We use a HUGE bubble-top pan we got from Ikea.
It is one of the few that doesn't boil over and spew everywhere for this operation.
It is an operation, it takes awhile for this to cook down!
You'll need to keep stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn!
If your hungry, smelling this cook will just make you HUNGRIER and it takes like 3 hours to cook.
It also smells WAY better than it tastes LOL It is PRETTY darn bland!I use to have it in the mornings with Agave Syrup and maybe some cinnamon.
Lately I've just been having it with salt because I'm healing I also add it to my meals, because it helps aid in my digestion.
So I guess I eat it like Grits!
Rice Grits!!!
New name!
haha I changed it!
Nobody knows what gruel is and it sounds so bad!
even tho its just hot cereal!
So I have Rice Grits with EVERYTHING as a side dish.
Or I eat it as a snack, just to keep me goin', like someone would eat oatmeal.
I cannot eat Gluten or Corn, so this is my alternative option :) You can use what you make to make soup out of as well...
There are a couple wasy to do this, I used to cook the Jook down to a watery consistency and spoon out the thicker part with a slotted spoon.
This gave me my Rice Grits to have in the fridge to eat, then I would add more water to the soupy mixture that was left and add ingredients to make soup, mostly vegetables, oo and sweet potatoes!!!
mmm, im gonna make some tomorrow!
:) You can also just double the water, not to start with, but cook down, add more and then cook again with vegetables.
This of course will make a thicker ricier soup.
I also use my leftovers to make soup base.
After I am done eating them as Grits, i just add them to water with veggies!

Push the mussels and pippies into the rice and cook until the shells open.
Finally add the peas, strips of capsicum and parsley and leave it for five more minutes on low heat.
Note: - Grind the saffron thread with some salt in a mortar and pestle until it is like a fine powder.
It will help to distribute it through the paella evenly giving a better colour and flavour to the finished dish.
- The perfect time to add the seafood to paella is when enough of the stock has been absorbed to allow the rice to be seen.
- Do not stir the paella during main cooking.

ABM:.
Place all ingredients (in order listed) in your bread machine, and set to dough cycle.
When complete, form into a loaf and place in a greased loaf pan.
Allow to rise to doubled.
Bake in 375 oven for 40 minutes, until it is golden and passes the knock test.
For a more rustic loaf, you can form onto a greased cookie sheet and allow to rise, or better yet, use a baking stone if you have one!
You could also allow your bread machine to follow a complete cycle, allowing it to bake in the machine.
KA or Stand Mixer:.
Place all ingredients in order listed, in bowl.
Mix using dough hook until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.
Dough shoud be smooth, slightly damp.
Oil a large bowl, and place dough in, swishing it around to coat.
Allow to rest for 30 minutes.
Fold dough (like you would a letter), turn 90 degrees, and repeat foldings.
Allow to rest 30 minutes more.
Repeat foldings.
Form into loaf and place in greased loaf pan, or onto a greased cookie sheet.
Allow to rise until doubled (2-3 hours.)
Bake in a 375 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes, until it is golden and passes the knock test.
Note #1: To proof your starter, feed it with 1 cup flour (preferably multigrain in this case) and 1 cup water, then let it sit overnight or up to 12 hours, covered.
This is what develops the characteristic sour flavor and the longer the proof, the sourer it will be.
If you start with 1/2 cup of starter and feed it 1 cup each of water and flour, you should have enough to make your bread and save the rest to start your next batch.
Note #2: To use a baking stone, allow your loaf to rise on parchment paper, placed on a board.
Place the stone in the oven when preheating it, allowing it 30 minutes to heat the stone.
Move the loaf onto the stone using the parchment paper (you can bake it right on the paper, on the stone.
).

Remove and add a pop stick in the center of each ice cube pop (they will slip right in when just partially frozen).
Place back in the freezer, preferably overnight.
When ready to serve, remove tray, lightly twist (to loosen cubes) and serve.
You will not see young ones with juice running down their arms from melting regular-sized freezer homemade pops.
They are easy to handle and are great to cool you down!
Easy and nutritious.
Some other combinations I like are cherry-lime pops, orange and cream, and chocolate Yoo Hoo pops.
Have fun with them.
We sure do!

Whisk the Genugel into the cold water first, then add to syrup.
Make sure the pot is at least 3 times the size of the liquid, as it foams up during boil.
Boil all ingredients to 217.
5 degrees F.
(Some people go to 219, but that makes unnecessarily hard jelly and wastes more content).
Here is the tricky part- The objective is to make clear jelly in the jar.
Any infusion of air through stirring or filling of the jars will put air bubbles into the jelly.
It will still taste fine, but won't look as good.
It helps greatly to keep a low flame under the jelly while bottling, as this stuff gels really fast and heat keeps it liquid longer.
First, skim off the surface foam as minimally as possible.
A lot of waste can occur at this point.
Second, have a cup or ladle large enough to fill each clean jar with ONE pour.
If you have to go back and add more to fill the jar, you will have air bubbles and layering.
Cap the filled jars and process them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes at 180 degrees.
Depending on how good you are at skimming, a half gallon of syrup will net you five to seven 8 ounce jars of maple jelly.
Yield is low and many people don't think it's worth the syrup or the trouble.

Spray the sides of a 2 1/2- to 3-qt saucepan with a non-stick vegetable coating (e.g.
PAM, Crisco).
Mix the sugar, cocoa, salt, cream, and corn syrup in the pan.
Stir over moderate heat (stirring slowly and carefully to avoid splashing the mix on the sides of the pan) till the sugar is dissolved and the mix comes to a boil.
Cover the saucepan for 2 or possibly 3 min.
(Covering the pan causes steam to create, that dissolves any sugar granules which may cling to the sides - one grain of sugar can start a chain reaction and turn the whole thing granular.
And the buttered pan helps; incidentally, it also keeps the fudge from boiling over.
If the pan has a spout and is therefore not airtight when you cover it, carefully hold a pot holder over the opening.
Now uncover, and place a candy thermometer in the pan.
Boil without stirring till the thermometer reaches 236 degrees or possibly the soft boil stage.
(Professionals advise 234 to 236 degrees during cool weather; 236 to 238 degrees in warmer weather.)
It is important now not to stir, mix, shake, or possibly disturb the mix.
Very carefully and gently remove the saucepan from the heat.
Don't remove the thermometer; don't stir it.
Let stand till temperature drops to 110 degrees.
While the fudge is cooling, prepare a pan for it.
I like to use a small loaf pan, that makes a 1 1/4-inch-thick layer of fudge.
Mine is called an 8 x 4-inch pan, that measures 7 x 3 1/2-inches on the bottom of the pan.
If you use a larger pan the fudge will be just as good but not as thick.
Fold two pcs of aluminum foil to fit the loaf pan, one for the length and one for the width.
Press them into place in the pan.
When the fudge has cooled to 110 degrees (at which temperature the bottom of the pan will feel comfortably hot to the palm of your hand) remove the thermometer.
Add in the Vanilla.
Now, to beat the fudge, use a moderately heavy wooden spatula or possibly wooden spoon.
Virginia's system, that works very comfortably, is to sit and grip the pan between your knees, leaving both hands free to grapple with the spatula.
First stir gently to incorporate the melted butter.
Then start to stir steadily or possibly to beat, and once you do, don't stop till the fudge is finished.
I think which knowing just how long to beat, and just when to pour, are the most important things in this recipe.
And the most difficult to describe.
To quote Virginia, "When the candy stiffens and loses its shine you are on borrowed time."
But I think which if you beat till it is stiff or possibly dull, it is too late.
Beat till the fudge becomes very thick, or possibly falls in thick globs, or possibly is thick sufficient to almost to hold its shape when a little is dropped from the spatula.
At this stage it should barely begin to lose it's shine, but only barely.
It should still be slightly glossy.
Quickly stir in the nuts and quickly, with the spatula, push the mix into the lined pan.
It will be too thick to pour.
And Virginia says which you shouldn't scrape the pan too well; scraping encourages grainy fudge.
Quickly push thefudge into a smooth layer in the pan; it may be easiest to use your fingertips or possibly your knuckles.
The fudge may be ready almost immediately (even while it is still slightly hot) to be cut into individually portions.
As soon as it feels hard, but before it hardens, remove it from the pan by lifting the foil, and with a long, sharp knife cut the fudge into portions.
I like to make 12 large squares, but you can make 24 or possibly more.
Don't let the fudge dry out.
Wrap the squares immediately, individually, in cellophane or possibly wax paper.
Or possibly package them in a airtight container.
Fudge is best the day it is made, but it will keep for a few days at room temperature if it is well wrapped.
For longer storage, freeze it.
It can be frzn for months.

For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or butter the baking sheets.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder and salt.
Set aside.
In a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter, sugar, dissolved coffee and vanilla extract until blended and smooth, about 1 minute.
Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing until the flour is incorporated and the dough holds together.
At first the dough will form fine crumbs; then it will come together in large clumps.
Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a smooth ball.
Place 1 piece of dough between 2 large pieces of wax paper and roll it out to slightly less than 1/4 inch thick.
Remove the top piece of wax paper.
Using a 2 1/2-inch star cutter, cut out cookies.
Slide a thin metal spatula under each cookie to loosen it, and place the cookies about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake the cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until the tops feel firm and look dull rather than shiny, about 15 minutes.
Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
Repeat with the second piece of dough, and then press all of the dough scraps together to form a smooth ball.
Repeat the rolling and cutting process.
For the icing: Dip a fork in the melted white chocolate and drizzle it randomly and generously over the tops of the cooled cookies.
Immediately sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy.
The candy will stick to the warm chocolate.
Let the cookies sit until the chocolate is firm.
The cookies can be stored between layers of wax paper in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 4 days.



Combine the stock, grapefruit juice, and sugar in a shallow heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Cook to the caramel stage; there will be wisps of smoke coming from the center of the pan.

Cover bowl opening with plastic wrap.
Wrap a big blanket around the bowl and place it aside to set overnight or for 10-12 hours.
In the morning you will have yogurt.
*note it will seem slightly more runny than the store bought yogurt at first but it thickens up after it has been refrigerated.
Enjoy!



Combine ingredients in food processor and blend on high speed for 56 minutes.
Add more water if necessary.
Note: If desired, to soften cashews, soak overnight in warm water (use just enough water to cover the cashews).
Use soaking water for the 2 cups of water referenced in this recipe.
Add natural sweeteners, extracts, or fruit for sweet variations, and add herbs, seasonings, and spices for savory recipes.



Using a wooden spoon, cream the butter until it's smooth (see tip below.)
Stir in the sugars and vanilla extract until they're evenly blended.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture one third at a time, stirring after each addition, until the dough is evenly blended.
Set aside half of the cookie dough.
Add the cocoa powder to the remaining dough and stir until it is fully incorporated.
Divide the chocolate dough in half.
Place each half on a large piece of plastic wrap, pat it into a 1/2-inch-thick square, and then wrap it in the plastic.
Repeat the process for the vanilla dough.
Refrigerate the 4 squares until firm, about 1 to 2 hours.
Unwrap one piece of the chilled vanilla dough, leaving it on the plastic.
Cover it with a second piece of plastic wrap, then roll it into a rectangle measuring about 9 by 7 inches.
If the dough gets too soft and difficult to roll, slide it onto a baking sheet and refrigerate it until it's firm again, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Unwrap a piece of the chocolate dough, cover it with another piece of plastic, and roll it into an 8- by 7-inch rectangle.
Remove the top piece of plastic wrap from both rolled doughs and invert the chocolate dough on top of the vanilla dough, lining up 3 sides and leaving about 1 inch of vanilla dough exposed on one side.
Starting at the opposite side, lift the vanilla dough by the plastic wrap underneath it and snugly roll up both layers into a log, peeling away the plastic wrap as you go.
Wrap the log in the plastic and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.
Repeat the process with the 2 other pieces of dough.
Heat the oven to 350F Line 2 shiny, heavy baking sheets with parchment paper.
Unwrap one of the logs and slice it into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.
(See tip below for a safe, kid-friendly way to slice dough.)
Arrange the slices on the parchment about 1 inch apart and bake them for about 13 minutes.
When done, they'll still be a little soft to the touch -- the cookies will have a better texture if you don't let their edges brown.
Leave the cookies on the sheet for 1 minute, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
Slice and bake the second log as the first.
A Kid-friendly Way to Slice Dough Slip a long piece of unflavored dental floss (about 20 inches) beneath the dough log.
Pull the ends up and over the log, crossing them.
Wrap the ends of the floss around your fingers and pull in opposite directions.



In a sauce pan over low heat, melt chocolate chips, corn syrup, brown sugar, and peanut butter, stirring frequently until smooth.

If youre starting with raw chicken breast, trim of fat and cook to your liking.
I rub black pepper and seasoned salt into mine and pan sear it until cooked through.
Once chicken is cooked, allow to cool for 10 minutes before chopping into cubes.
Or you can use 1 1/2 cups of leftover cooked chicken.
Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well.
Adjust seasoning to taste if desired.
Serve with crackers or, if you prefer, on a sandwich.



Leave the butter at room temperature to soften.
Mix the butter with sugar and cream them until the sugar dissolves completely.
When the mixture is fluffy, add the milk little by little and whisk constantly until you obtain a texture like mayonnaise.
Sift the flour twice beforehand and sift it into the butter mixture.
Mix quickly with a plastic spatula.
At first the mixture looks crumbly but it gradually starts to look like stiff cream.
Put the mixture into a piping bag and pipe the mixture out by starting in the centre and going around outwards to make rose shapes.
Bake in the pre-heated oven to 170C (338 Fahrenheit) for 15 to 20 minutes.
Check the colour now and then.
After baking leave to cool and put transfer to a storing jar.
Left: rose-shaped cookies by me.
Right: cherry-blossom-shaped cookies by my daughter
When you put the cookie dough into a piping bag it is easier to do so by putting the piping bag in a large cup.
When you buy cream tubs plastic nozzles come as a free gifts.
You can use them with this recipe.
I showed how to pipe the cookie dough in detail in.
One Cookpad user made these cookies using food colouring for rose-shaped cookies.
They look very passionate and beautiful, don't they?
Another Cookpad user made these using cocoa powder.
They're good for Valentine's day.
A zoomed-up photo of a rose shape.
Take it easy when you're squeezing the dough out.
There's no need to panic!
It should be just like coaxing the dough around in a circular motion.
I used cream for the first time in a long time but the resultant cookies were quite hard.
It might be caused of being whipped too much?
Milk is better to handle.
In winter the dough is harder so it might be difficult to pipe out.
Rub the dough while it is in the bag to soften it.
At Step 2 the the texture you want is like one of mayonnaise.
When it is cold the butter hardens, so warm it over a bain-marie if necessary.
Do not melt it, though.



Mix dressing, cheese and bacon bits in large bowl; add potatoes and toss.

1.
Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
2.
Add the butter into the bowl.
Using your hands, or a pastry cutter, carefully work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles peas.
3.
Create a well in the middle of the mixture.
While slowly swirling your hand in the dry ingredients, slowly stream in the milk.
The batter should be very wet and sticky.
4.
Once the dough comes together, gently fold the blueberries into the dough.
Note: I used frozen blueberries, but you may use fresh if you have them on hand.
5.
Dust a rolling mat with flour.
You will want to be generous here so the dough does not stick.
Place the dough in the middle of the flour and carefully coat dough with flour, pressing lightly.
Knead the dough lightly, 3-4 times.
Shape into a flattened round, approximately 1/2 thick.
6.
Using a well-floured biscuit cutter, cut the biscuits and place them on a liberally greased baking sheet.
Fold together any scrap pieces and shape it back into a 1/2 thick round.
Use the biscuit cutter and cut again.
Repeat to get as many biscuits from the dough as possible.
Note: In the South, it is traditional to even use the final scraps to make a small biscuit.
We do not let any of the glorious dough go to waste!
7.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
8.
Remove from the oven and allow biscuits to sit while you make the glaze.
9.
For the glaze, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla, and lemon juice in a small bowl.

Before using, stir over low heat until butter melts; keep warm.)



Mix together the scallions, ginger, oil, soy, vinegar, and salt in a bowl.
Taste and check for salt, adding more if needed.
Though its best after 15 or 20 minutes of sitting, ginger scallion sauce is good from the minute its stirred together up to a day or two in the fridge.
Use as directed, or apply as needed.



Turn oven on to 300F (150C).
Line a 26 x 36 cm x 5 cm (11 x 14 x 2") pan with baking paper (silicon paper).

In standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds.
Add confectioners sugar and salt; beat at medium-low speed until most of the sugar is moistened, about 45 seconds.
Scrape down bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture is fully combined, about 15 seconds.
Scrape bowl, add vanilla, cinnamon, and heavy cream, and beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 10 seconds.
Then increase speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice.



Microwave coconut on high on plate, 1 to 2 minutes, until toasted; spoon over yogurt with pineapple.



Spread the oil over a baking sheet.
Spread almonds evenly over the surface of the sheet.
In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan, stir the sugar and cream of tartar into the water over low heat until dissolved.
When the sugar is dissolved, increase the heat to medium and stop stirring.
Bring to a boil and allow temperature, as measured with a candy thermometer, to 300 degrees F (hard crack stage).
Immediately pour the syrup over the almonds and allow to cool and harden completely.
Break into pieces to serve.



Pour cream into a large, screw-top jar.
The jar should be large enough that the cream only fills it up 1/2-2/3 full.
Ensure the lid is screwed tightly onto the jar.
Shake the jar vigorously.
Keep shaking continuously.
The cream will froth up after a time and will seem to stop moving in the jar - don't worry!
Just keep shaking - over time you will see the cream start to resemble a sort of whipped cottage cheese, and then it will form a solid, yellowish mass, surrounded by an ever-growing pool of white liquid.
Shake the jar another 2-3 minutes.
In total, it will have been shook for around 25 minutes, depending on the temperature of the cream.
Suspend a fine sieve over a bowl and empty the jar contents into it.
Using a clean spoon, beat, press and fold the butter, teasing out as much liquid as you can.
Beat a pinch of salt, if desired, into the butter, and then take the mass in your hands.
Press and roll it gently, as if you are kneading a bread dough, until the butter starts to become quite smooth and sticky.
Store the butter in a ceramic dish.
The collected liquid is buttermilk (or whey) and can be used in baking.



Mix all ingredients in bowl in order listed.
Make small or medium size balls out of mixture and place on a greased cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.
For extra happy horses you can sprinkle a little bit of honey on them before cooking.

Rinse the vegetables under cold, running water using a scrub brush.



Combine all ingredients and whisk to blend well.
Serve with chef or chunky chicken salads.



Combine dry ingredients.
Add applesauce and molasses.
Press firmly into a greased 13x9 baking dish.
Bake at 325 for 20 minutes.
Cool at least 15 minutes, and cut into bars.
*You can use up to 1/2 cup applesauce if you want a much softer granola bar, or decrease for even more crunch.
Coconut is absolutely optional, but it adds something special to the consistency without drawing attention to itself.
*I really believe this recipe would lend itself well to any whole grain flour.
I've only tried the two listed here, and maybe oat flour once, but I hope to try other flours sometime.
*I can get molasses cheap in bulk, so I use that in this recipe.
The original called for honey, but it's too expensive for me to keep much on hand, and the granola bars made with honey were really bland, even with some vanilla added, so I prefer the molasses.
If you prefer to use honey, just add 1/4 cup, a little vanilla, and substitute 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the white.
Don't use vanilla with the molasses--tastes weird.
Besides, everything is cheaper without vanilla.



1.
Hold each radish by the tip end.
Shave radishes into ribbons with a vegetable peeler to measure 4 1/2 cups.
Repeat procedure with carrots, shaving to measure 6 cups.

Cover and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.
Store in an airtight container in refrigerator up to 3 days.



Break up the almond bark into pieces and turn your crockpot to high.
Add the almond bark to the crock pot, stir occasionally until mostly melted, and then turn the crock pot to low.
Add in the chocolate chips until it gets to a nice, dark, chocolate-y color.
Pour in about 3/4 of the peanuts and give it a stir.
If the chocolate to peanut ratio is too high, add some more peanuts.
You can test this by dropping a spoonful of the chocolate/peanuts onto a wax paper or parchment-lined countertop.
It should be thick and peanut-y (technical term!)
and not spread out all over the place.
Add more peanuts or chocolate chips as needed to get the consistency you prefer.
Drop by spoonfuls (or use a melon baller, if you have one) on the parchment-lined baking sheet and allow to harden.
This makes lots and lots of peanut clusters, so be sure to clear off some counter space beforehand.
These should harden in about one hour, depending on how big you make them.



Combine first three ingredients in a large bowl; set aside.

Serve warm.



Dump everything in a bowl.
Give it all a stir with a spoon, so that it's pretty well mixed (it can still be lumpy, though--the main thing is you don't want to have dry cocoa powder, as it'll go all over if you try to mix it).
Use a hand mixer to mix it all together until stiff and fluffy.
It should be thicker than whipped cream.
Feel free to add other ingredients after getting it to the right texture, too.
I like to add in cocoa powder if I think it's not chocolaty enough.
And it's never chocolaty enough.



Grease 8 metal lollipop molds.
Combine corn syrup water and sugar in small sauce pan over low heat, stirring just till the sugar dissolves.

**If youre not familiar with the 5 Minutes a Day approach, youll need a LARGE (a gallon at least) container with a lid.
I use a gallon ice cream tub with a hole poked in the lid (you dont want the lid to be airtight or itll explode with the expanding gases as the dough rises).
Youll also need enough fridge space to store this container until you use all the dough.
You should also know that this recipe will make 3-4 medium sized (about a pound) loaves.
But that wont be a problem.
Oh, and once youve tried this approach, it WILL change your everyday life.
If youre a bread person, at least.
1.
In your storage tub, combine the warm water, yeast, and salt.
Swirl or stir gently to dissolve the yeast.
2.
Add the flours and sunflower seeds all at once.
3.
Stir with a spoon until the dough begins to come together.
Then get your hands in there and mix until all the liquid is incorporated and there are patches of dry flour left over.
4.
Put the lid on the container (you may not want to seal it yet and remember dont use an airtight lid!)
and let the dough rise at room temperature for three hours or so.
At this point it should have not quite doubled in size.
(I found this dough didnt rise as much as others, but it has an amazing oven lift.)
Stick it in the fridge over night.
5.
About an hour before you want to eat the bread, preheat the oven to 450F and place a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven.
6.
Now prepare your baking surface.
You can use a pizza stone (which you should preheat with the oven), but I dont have one, so Ive been using a normal half-sheet pan.
To use a normal half-sheet pan, you need to spread a thin layer of cornmeal or semolina on the pan roughly in the shape and size of your loaf.
This will keep it from sticking.
7.
Then pull out a chunk of dough about the size of a softball (or however big you want the loaf to be) and shape the loaf: what you want to do is create a gluten cloak.
To do this you need to sort of flatten (not squish) your dough into a disc and then roll the edges toward the bottom.
Youll be able to see the strands of gluten forming and creating almost a network across the top of the loaf.
I like an oblong loaf shape for this bread, but it really doesnt much matter what shape you give it.
(*See photo) 8.
Once youve shaped the loaf, roll the top and sides of it in the extra sunflower seeds until the loaf is pretty generously coated.
Place it on top of the cornmeal on your baking sheet and make sure the bottom is pretty thoroughly coated in the cornmeal.
Trust me: you do NOT want your bread sticking.
Then slash the loaf: take a sharp knife and cut a slash about 3/4 right down the middle of the loaf (lengthwise).
This will give it room to rise and will make it look awfully pretty.
Let the bread rest at room temperature for 20 minutes while the oven pre-heats.
9.
Bake it for 30 minutes.
It should be evenly browned (my oven is really small and heats unevenly, so I rotate the loaf halfway through to ensure even browning) and when its done it will sound hollow if you tap on the bottom of the loaf.
(You *may* need an additional 5 or so minutes and definitely more if you bake a considerably larger loaf.)
Let it cool for a few minutes before you tear into it.
Itll give it time to compose itself and will lessen the likelihood that youll burn the dickens out of your mouth.
(Not that it wouldnt have been worth it.)



Combine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan; cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves, stirring frequently.

Cut an empty plastic soda bottle in half.
Heat water to dissolve the sugar.
Let cool and pour into bottom half.
Add yeast.
Place the top part of the bottle upside down into the other half of the bottle, forming a funnel; tape pieces together with black tape (the mosquitos are attracted to dark colors).
Leave the funnel top uncovered; place container outside and away from your normal gathering areas.
Mosquitoes are drawn to the carbon dioxide created by the yeast and dark color.
Change the mixture every two weeks.

Rinse the raisins gently under warm running water.
In a small bowl, combine the raisins with 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons dark rum.
Set aside.
(Its best to do this step one hour in advance, if possible, to give the raisins a chance to plump up with the rum/water.)
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
In a pot, combine the rice, 2 cups water, and 1/2 teaspoon rum extract.
Bring the pot up to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low.

When the rice is tender remove from heat and add the sugar and ground cinnamon.
Return to heat and cook until the pudding thickens, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and add the vanilla extract.
Spoon the pudding into your seeving bowls.
If you like your pudding hot, eat it now.
If you like your pudding cool, cover it with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours.
Remember that the longer you keep it in the fridge, the drier it will become.

Stir together water, yeast, sugar and 2 tablespoons flour.
Leave to stand for 15 minutes in a warm position.
At the end of 15 minutes this should have about 2 inches of froth on top.
In a large bowl put in 8-10 cups plain flour.
Add a pinch of salt and stir.
Make a well in centre and add the yeast mixture.
Gradually stir in flour but don't add too much flour at once - a light hand is the story.
When the liquid has absorbed as much flour as necessary for it to be kneaded place on a floured board (in my case on1y plain paper) and knead until you can sit the dough in the palm of hand.
Spread some plain flour on a baking board.
Let this stand for 15 minutes -- this is the working time for the yeast and the dough should be nice and spongy and fluffy.
As soon as I have let the dough stand for 15 minutes I prepare my cooking pot.
Sufficient lard, dripping, cooking oil or tallow to cover at least 1/3 of cooking utensil.
Heat until blue smoke rises (for us in NZ on electric store this takes 15 minutes).
Cooking tip: If the fat does not smoke at end of 15 minutes add a wee bit of used fat -- new fat takes forever to reach the required temperature.
Again!
Don't worry overly much about the dough.
If it fluffs up nice and spongy and fat is not ready to fry bread, then just knead the dough again and let stand, but perhaps for only 10 minutes this time.
All things being equal, the dough and the fat should be ready together by this time.
So press the dough out (add flour if the board is sticky).
Cut into required (triangles, squares, etc) shaped, pressing to about 1/4 inch thick.
Fry one side, then brown fry other side and there is your bread.
Well, hope you enjoy your cooking and eating.

Work the dough together well with your hands.
Transfer the dough to a flat surface and knead it until smooth and elastic, 3 to 5 minutes.
The dough should feel moist, but if it sticks to your fingers or the countertop, add a little flour.
The dough is fully kneaded when you slice into it with a sharp knife and see small air bubbles throughout.
Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a clean tea towel, and place in a draft-free place to rise for about an hour.
Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and carefully shape each piece into a 12-inch- (5-centimeter-) long loaf, about 11/2 inches (4 centimeters) thick.
Place on the baking sheet, cover, and let rise for about 45 minutes.
While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 450F (230C).
When the loaves have finished rising, bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool.
Maintain oven temperature.
Using a knife, cut both loaves into 20 equally sized slices.
Place the slices close together on the baking sheet and toast at 450F (230C) until they have a nice golden color, about 5 minutes.
If the baking sheet doesn't fit all the slices, divide them onto two baking sheets.
Both sheets can be baked at the same time, but be sure to switch them from upper to lower levels in the oven halfway through.
Lower the heat to 200F (95C) to dry out the rolls for 20 to 30 minutes.
Turn the oven off and leave the rolls in the oven for 4 to 5 hours more until they are dry, light, and crispy.
If you bake these in the evening, you can also leave them in overnight and take them out in the morning.
Store in an airtight container.

Butter 17- by 12-inch rimmed baking sheet.
Line with parchment paper, leaving 1-inch overhang on each end, and butter paper.
In large heatproof steel bowl, toss together cereal and nuts.
In heavy large saucepan over moderate heat, stir together sugar and 6 tablespoons water.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves, then raise heat to moderately high and boil without stirring, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, until syrup turns deep amber in color, about 8 minutes.
Carefully stir in cream (mixture may splatter and briefly harden) then stir in butter.
Remove from heat and stir in salt and vanilla.
Drizzle caramel over cereal-nut mixture and, using heatproof silicone spatula or wooden spoon, stir until fully incorporated.

Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl.
Stir with one hand to blend.
Add the shortening, breaking it into 2 or 3 manageable chunks.
To combine the ingredients, pick up some flour and shortening and quickly rub it between your hands in a gentle sliding motion from the heel of your hand to your fingertips.
Work over the bowl so that the mixture falls back into the bowl.
Continue picking up and rubbing more of the mixture until you no longer see lumps of shortening.
This process takes less than 1 minute.
Work in the water, one-third at a time, using your fingers or a spatula to moisten the flour mixture after each addition.
When all the water has been incorporated, you should be able to press the ragged mass of dough and all the bits into a ball.
Transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface; it should not stick.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes, until it is relatively smooth and somewhat elastic.
Push your finger into the dough; it should slowly bounce back with a noticeable dent left behind.
Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours before using.
(The dough can be refrigerated overnight.
Return to room temperature before using.)

In a large, heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the sugars and milk over medium high heat.
Stir CONSTANTLY until mixture reasches 228 degrees on a candy thermometer.
Add butter, peanut butter and pecans and continue to stir until mixture reaches 240 degrees.
Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
Beat VIGOROUSLY with a WOODEN spoon until mixture begins to thicken and lose the glossy appearance.

Preheat the oven to 350F (175C).
In a small mixing bowl, stir together the egg whites, sugar, and vanilla.
Stir in the salt and half of the flour, then mix in the melted butter.
Beat in the rest of the flour until smooth.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread 2 level tablespoons of the batter into a circle 6 inches (15 cm) across.
Try to get the circles as even and smooth as possible (youre likely to get 2 rounds on one standard baking sheet).
Put the baking sheet in the oven and begin checking the cones after about 10 minutes.
Depending on your oven, theyll take between 10 and 15 minutes to bake.
The circles should be a deep golden brown throughout (some lighter and darker spots are inevitable, so dont worry).
Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Use a thin metal spatula to loosen the edge of one disk.
Slide the spatula under the disk, quickly flip it over, and immediately roll it around the cone-rolling form, pressing the seam firmly on the counter to close the cone and pinching the point at the bottom securely closed.
Let the cone cool slightly on the mold until it feels firm, then slide it off and stand it upright in a tall glass to cool.
Roll the other cone the same way.
(If its too firm, return the baking sheet to the oven for a minute or so until its pliable again.)
Repeat, using the remaining batter.
Youll find it easier to spread the batter if you slide the reusable parchment paper off the baking sheet; any heat from the baking sheet will make the batter fussy to spread.
For Sesame or Poppy Seed Ice Cream Cones, stir 3 tablespoons (35 g) toasted sesame or poppy seeds and a bit of grated lemon zest into the batter.

For Gingersnap Ice Cream Cones, add 1 tablespoon mild molasses and 1/4 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg to the batter.
Increase the sugar to 1/2 cup (100 g).
For Honey-Cornmeal Ice Cream Cones, substitute 1 large egg and 1 egg white for the 1/4 cup (60 ml) egg whites.
Melt 2 teaspoons of strongly flavored honey with the butter, and substitute 1/2 cup (70 g) of flour and 1/4 cup (35 g) of stone-ground cornmeal for the 2/3 cup (90 g) flour.
For Rosemary Ice Cream Cones, add 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary to the Honey-Cornmeal Ice Cream Cone batter.
The batter can be made up to 4 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
Let the batter come to room temperature before using.
Once baked and cooled, store the cones in an airtight container until ready to serve.

Apples don't need thickening, but berries and pears are juicier.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.



Put ingredients into bread pan in the order suggested by the manufacturer of the bread machine.
If you're going to use a timer, it is vital to keep the yeast away from both the liquids AND the salt.
I make this on the white bread cycle and it comes out great, but you may wish to use the whole wheat cycle.
I never noticed any difference except that the whole wheat cycle took a lot longer.
Your machine may yield different results, tho.

If you need a thicker frosting, say for outlining your cookies, add LESS milk.
Just a drop at a time.
If you have already outlined your cookies and need a to fill in or spill your cookies, you can add more milk (as much as you would need) to make your frosting very runny.
If you are using food coloring, be sure to use LESS milk.
Most food colorings are liquid and can make your frosting more runny.
If you are using a gel food coloring, your milk quanity can remain the same.
If you want to add different flavors, you can add drops of vanilla extract, almond extract, lemon, etc.
to flavor your frosting.
If you want more SHINE, use more corn syrup and less milk.
This frosting will stay good for days in the fridge.

Carefully line an 8" square baking pan with parchment paper.
Fold the corners carefully and tape the sides if necessary.
Don't worry, it doesn't get baked!
Add sugar, butter and evaporated milk to a heavy 2 quart saucepan.
On high heat, stir mixture and bring to a full rolling boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue boiling and stirring for 5 minutes, making sure to continuously scrape down the sides.
Remove from heat, and allow to cool for 2 minutes.
Add peanut butter, and stir until completely melted and incorporated.
Add vanilla and marshmallows, and stir until completely melted and incorporated.
There should be no visible streaks of peanut butter or marshmallow.
Pour mixture into parchment lined baking pan, tilting or shaking for uniform thickness.
While mixture is still warm, press M&Ms into the top of the fudge.
I use an even grid pattern, typically 7 across and 7 down.
Keep in mind that it's much easier to cut around M&Ms than through them.
Press deeply enough to avoid popping out later.
If M&Ms start to crack after being pressed into the fudge, the mixture is too hot.
In that case, wait a few minutes, and try again.
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Carefully lift out the fudge by grabbing opposite sides of the parchment paper.
Cut even rows between M&Ms, cleaning your knife in hot water between cuts, or when buildup causes messy cutting.
Assemble a second set of ingredients, and get ready to make another batch because these will be gone before you know it!

Knead the dough for about 1 minute, then let rest on floured surface for a few minutes (just while you get the yummy toppings ready).
Roll out to a diameter of about 13-14 inches.
For a soft crust, add your favorite toppings and bake at 450 degrees F until crust begins to brown (about 15 minutes).
For a crispy crust, bake crust at 450 degrees F for 3-5 minutes, then add toppings and continue baking for another 10 or so minutes.
I like to spread olive oil on the crust before putting sauce and toppings on, and I also sprinkle seasonings (such as garlic powder, oregano, Italian seasoning) and grated Parmesan cheese on top!

Prepare a cookie sheet by greasing with 1 tablespoon butter.
In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter.
Once melted, add sugar, corn syrup, and salt.
You want it to cook very slowly, not boiling quickly because you do not want sugar crystals to form.
Medium heat is best.
You can stir it occasionally, but do not scrape around the sides of the pan.
This could cause crystals to form.
The slower the boil, the smoother the candy.
Continue to cook until candy thermometer reads 295 degrees F.
Meanwhile, pour slivered almonds onto the greased cookie sheet.

Make sure your elbow grease factor is in fine tune condition and then go to town.
Continue to work it and knead it until it is like a cookie dough.
Now you can either place small balls into your favorite partially thawed ice cream or you can eat it now.
I usually put the dough in small amounts in french vanilla ice cream and then re-chill it.
Of course since this is a real simple fix for cookie dough you could add chocolate chips or whatever and make cookies.
By these measures there won't be much but you can alter it.

I made these scones with chopped chocolate folded into the dough in Step 2.
I made these ones with blueberry syrup mixed into the dough.
The color is a little off but it's good.
These are great to use as gifts (cocoa flavored + chocolate chips) You can also make milk tea flavored ones by using the contents of a tea bag and some thick milk tea.
These are with cranberry and fig, and cocoa powder and chocolate chip.
If you cut out 6 cm circular shapes, you get exactly 6 scones.
They will rise to about 7.5-8 cm high.
If you make them thick, they will come out moist.
These use black cocoa powder + white chocolate chips.
They taste just like Oreos.

Start by picking over the raspberries very carefully and discarding any leaves or stems.
Put half of the fruit into a preserving pan and use a potato masher to coarsely crush it.
Add the remaining fruit and sugar (the mixture will look mouthwateringly good).
Stir over low heat to dissolve the sugar.
Bring to a rolling boil, then boil for exactly 5 minutes.
(If you prefer a firmer jam, continue boiling at this stage for a further 2 to 3 minutes.)
Remove from the heat, stirring to disperse any scum.
It is important to pour and cap this low-sugar jam quickly (see pp.
2122), but you must allow it to cool just a little first (give it 5 to 6 minutes) to prevent all those little raspberry seeds from rushing to the top of the jar, leaving you with half a jar of raspberry jelly and half a jar of raspberry seeds.
Use within 1 year.
Flavorful ripe strawberries give very good results with this simple recipe too.
Hull the strawberries, halve or quarter larger ones, and continue as above.



To Make Crust:.
In a food processor, pulse the flour, butter, sugar, and salt until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size clumps of butter remaining.
Add 2 tablespoons of the water.
Pulse until the mixture holds together when squeezed but is still crumbly (add more water, a little at a time, as necessary).
Avoid overprocessing, which will make the dough tough.
Place the still crumbly mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap.
Shape it into a 1-inch-thick disk, using the plastic wrap to help.
Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.
(The dough can be frozen at this point for up to 2 months.
).
NOTE - you can also pat the crust into the pie pan at this point, then refrigerate at least one hour before baking.
To Prepare Crust for Baking:.
Place the disk of dough on a floured piece of parchment or wax paper.
Using your knuckles, make indentations around the perimeter of the dough (this will help prevent cracking when you roll the dough out).
With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into an 12-inch circle (work from the center outward, and use the parchment to rotate the dough).
Flour the rolling pin, parchment, and dough as necessary to prevent sticking.
Loosen the dough from the parchment and carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie plate.
Fit the dough into the plate (avoid stretching).
Trim the dough to a 1-inch overhang and tuck it under itself to create a thick rim.
With the index finger of one hand, press the dough against the thumb and forefinger of the opposite hand; continue around the perimeter of the crust.
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days before using.



Beat butter in a mixing bowl for 30 seconds.
Add sugar, baking powder, soda, and cardamon; beat until combined.
Beat in sour cream until combined.
Beat in as much flour as you can; stir in any remaining flour.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoons onto cookie sheets lined with waxed paper.
Place sheets in freezer; freeze 45 minutes or until firm.

Remove the vanilla bean as soon as the mixture comes to a boil.
Use the pointed tip of a knife to dig out the vanilla seeds and add them back to the praline mixture.
Individually wrapped or stored in an airtight container, the pralines will keep for about 3 days.



NOTE: In Egypt, as in much of the Middle East, rice is eaten in enormous quality.
This mold, therefore, is mainly composed of rice (about 9 c. when cooked), and the chicken is more or possibly less a flavorful accompaniment for the rice.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (F).
Using a pastry brush, heavily coat the bottom and sides of a round, deep 3 qt casserole or possibly baking dish with the 4 Tbsp.
of softened butter.
Spread 1 c. of the rice proportionately in the dish, arrange the pcs of chicken skin side up on top and sprinkle them liberally with salt and pepper.
In a small saucepan, bring the lowfat milk, cream and 2 c. of the stock to a boil over high heat and pour over the chicken.
Spread the rest of the rice on top and dot proportionately with the 2 Tbsp.
of the cut up butter.
Bake uncovered on the lowest shelf of the oven for 15 min.
Meanwhile, bring the remaining 2 c. of stock to a simmer in a small saucepan and keep it barely simmering over low heat.
Pour 1 c. of the simmering stock into the casserole and bake for 15 min longer.
Pour in the remaining stock and transfer the casserole to the upper third of the oven.
Continue baking for another 30 min, then remove the casserole from the oven, cover tightly with a lid or possibly foil and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 min.
To unmold and serve, run a sharp knife around the inside edges of the casserole to loosen the biram ruzz and let it rest for 10 min longer.
Place a heated serving platter upside down over the top, and, grasping the casserole and platter together firmly, quickly invert them.
The biram ruzz should slide out easily.
Serve at once.

This can be made in 3 batches in a large food processor.
Whiz regular oatmeal, measure 1 cup, whiz in the nutritional yeast.
Mix thoroughly with cake flour or substitute, then carefully mix in salt, baking soda, baking powder, and sugar.
Blend this with the buttermilk powder until it is uniform- a sifter is handy here if you aren't using a food processor.
In the food processor or a large bowl, cut together 1/3 of the flour mix, 1/3 each of the shortening and butter until it resembles coarse cornmeal.
Set aside and repeat until all is used, then mix the three batches together before you divide it for storage or use.
Store in tightly closed covered container or zippered plastic bags with the air pressed out.
Even with the added flours, this makes a golden white biscuit unless whole wheat flour is added.
To use, spoon into cup, don't sift and don't pack.
Store remainder in refrigerator or freezer.
Reduced fat variation: you can reduce the shortening in this mix by 1/4, results will be a bit less tender, but still tasty.
With reduced fat baking recipes, smaller sizes muffins, biscuits and pancakes will give better results.
Fat may be reduced in most baking recipes by one-third.
Fat makes baked goods tender and crisp, so lowering the amount of fat will change the texture as well as the flavor.
With pie crusts, the fat may be decreased to one part fat to four parts flour.
Some have had success also with replacing some of the fat in quick bread recipes with the same amount of applesauce.
I have found it does work but the texture is tougher than the original recipe.

Get a sharp knife out and cut the leaves off of the strawberries
Slice the strawberries to however thin you please and then put them in a bowl
Sprinkle your sugar/artificial sweetener onto the strawberries and enjoy your delicious dessert or snack



Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.
If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 2 minutes.
If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for 2 minutes, until well blended.
If the spoon gets too doughy, dip it in a bowl of warm water.
The dough should be very soft, sticky, coarse, and shaggy, but still doughlike.
Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl.
Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
To stretch and fold the dough in the bowl, with wet or oiled hands or a wet bowl scraper, reach under the front end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough.
Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.
The dough should be significantly firmer, though still very soft and fragile.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Repeat this stretch and fold process three more times, completing all repetitions within 40 to 45 minutes.
The dough will be a little firmer than when first mixed and the shaggy texture will have smoothed out somewhat, but it will still spread out to fill the bowl.
After the final stretch and fold, return the dough to the lightly oiled bowl, and immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days.
The dough will rise to about double, and possibly triple, its original size within 4 to 12 hours in the refrigerator.
(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)
Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before you plan to bake.
Rub the work surface with a few drops of olive or vegetable oil, then use a wet bowl scraper or wet hands to transfer the dough to the work surface.
Divide the dough in half (about 21 oz or 595 g each) for two large loaves; into 4 to 6 pieces for smaller loaves; or into 18 to 24 pieces for rolls.
Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat, then mist it lightly with spray oil or dust it with flour, semolina, or cornmeal.
(If using a banneton or proofing mold, mist it with spray oil, then dust it with flour.)
Have a small bowl of bread flour standing by.
With floured hands, gently pat the dough pieces into rectangles, then stretch it into torpedos (see page 21), boules (see page 20), or loaves (see page 23), or shape it into rolls (see page 25).
With floured hands, gently lift the dough and place it seam side down on the prepared pan (or seam side up in the proofing mold).
If air bubbles form, pinch the surface to pop them.
Mist the surface of the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let the shaped dough sit, covered, at room temperature for 60 minutes.
Then, remove the covering and let the dough proof for an additional 60 minutes.
The dough will spread slightly and the skin will begin to dry out a bit.
About 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C) or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30).
Just before baking, score the dough with a sharp serrated knife or razor blade.
The dough will have spread somewhat but should still have its basic shape, and the shape should spring back in the oven.
(If using a banneton or proofing mold, remove the dough from the basket at this stage.)
Transfer the dough to the oven, pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C), or 425F (218C) for a convection oven.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is a rich golden brown and the internal temperature is 200F to 205F (93C to 94C).
For a crisper crust, turn off the oven and leave the bread in for another 5 to 10 minutes before removing (rolls will take less time).
Cool the bread on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

There are a lot of little tricks to handling chocolate.
I like to work on a marble surface because the marble is generally cold, which helps the chocolate set.
I also keep my chocolate in a glass bowl, which retains heat well and holds the temper longer.
One of the most useful things you can use when working with chocolate is acetate (plastic from the florist).
It can be found in most art shops.
To make dark and white chocolate cigarettes: Use a cake comb to create alternating stripes of white and dark chocolate.
You can buy one at most cake decorating supply stores.
Spread some white chocolate on a sheet of acetate in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch.
Draw the comb through the chocolate to create alternating lines.
Return the excess chocolate to the bowl.
When the chocolate stripes are firm but not hard, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate.
When the chocolate sets but is not firm, use a pastry triangle to create the cigarettes.
Start about 11/2 inches from an edge and push the chocolate into a roll (it will form naturally).
Apply even pressure.
To make chocolate fans: Spread some dark chocolate directly onto the marble surface in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch.
Use the pastry triangle to create fans by pushing the triangle through the chocolate in an arc.
Use your finger to hold down one side as you push the chocolate toward the other.

Preheat the oven to 350F Line an 8&#8243; x 8&#8243; x 2&#8243; pan in one direction with parchment paper, allowing it to go up the opposing sides.
Lightly grease the parchment paper and the exposed pan, or coat with a non-stick spray.
Stir together all the dry ingredients, including the fruit and nuts.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the vanilla, melted butter or oil, liquid sweeteners and water.
Toss the wet ingredients with the dry (and peanut butter, if youre using it) until the mixture is evenly crumbly.
Spread in the prepared pan, pressing them in firmly to ensure they are molded to the shape of the pan.
(A piece of plastic wrap can help with this, as you press down on the back of it.
).
Bake the bars for 30 to 40 minutes, until theyre brown around the edges dont be afraid to get a little color on the tops too.
Theyll still seem soft and almost underbaked when you press into the center of the pan but do not worry, theyll set completely once completely cool.
Cool the bars in their pan completely on a cooling rack.
(Alternately, after about 20 minutes you can use your parchment sling to lift and remove the bars, and place them in their paper on the rack to cool the rest of the way.
This can speed the process up.
).
Once cool, a serrated knife (or bench knife) to cut the bars into squares.
[Updating to note, as many had crumbling issues:] If bars seem crumbly, chill the pan of them further in the fridge for 30 minutes which will fully set the glue, then cut them cold.
To store, wrap the bars individually in plastic or stack them in an airtight container.
In humid weather, its best to store bars in the refrigerator.
They also freeze well.



In a heavy gauged saucepan, whisk all the ingredients and bring to boil over medium high heat.
Then, turn down heat until you get a rapid simmer.

Put into a plastic bag and roll it out until about 15 x 20cm.
You'll use a rolling pin later, so don't worry about how thin it is.
Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
This will harden the butter and make the dough easier to work with.
Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 8 portions.
Roll each portion out with your fingers until about 1cm thick.

In a saucepan place sugar, cocoa and the milk and stir with a whisk .
Take the butter and slice into this mixture over low heat until all is mixed and melted.
Bring this to a rolling boil and boil for 2 l/2 minutes...
I test it by taking a cup of cold water and putting a spoonful of the mixture into the cold water.
If it forms a ball it has boiled long enough.
If it does not form a ball, it is not done yet.
This may take 3 minutes.
Turn off heat and add the peanut butter.
Stir until it is mixed and then with heavy spoon mix in the oats and stir all together and drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper.

(Check the color by drizzling some onto a white plate.)
Dont worry if the sugar hardens while cooking; simply stir it and continue cooking until it smooths out.
Add the blueberries and 1/2 cup water to the caramel; be careful, as the caramel will bubble and steam a great deal.
Stir the blueberries into the caramel as well as possible (the sauce will harden when the cold blueberries are added, but will loosen up again as the blueberries heat up).
Cover the pan and reduce the heat to low.
Allow the sauce to simmer with the lid on until most of the blueberries have popped and are exuding their juices, about 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and stir the sauce to further dissolve any hardened bits of caramel.
(Dont worry if there are some lumps; they will be strained out.)
Strain the sauce to remove any blueberry skins, seeds, and hard pieces of caramel.
Add the lime juice and return to a saucepan.
Cook further over medium heat until the sauce can be spooned onto a room-temperature plate and keep its shape without being too runny.

Instructions: Whisk all ingredients together.
Yep, that was hard, huh?
Okay, so this makes a lot of frozen yogurt.
Probably more than your ice cream maker can handle at one time.
It was about twice the amount my Cuisinart could handle.
So, I poured half of the prepared ingredients mixture into the ice cream maker and reserved the other half in the fridge until the first half was done.
I didnt even have to refreeze the bowl, it had enough oomph to freeze it all.
Snazzy, eh?
I love Cuisinart.
So, working quickly, spoon the frozen yogurt into a freezable container and store in the freezer until the next half of yogurt is done.
Also, I suppose you could reserve the other half of the unfrozen liquid in the frig until you were ready for it.
It took about 25-30 minutes for it to freeze in the ice cream maker.
Once all your yogurt is frozen, resist the temptation to eat it all and freeze it for several hours to let it ripen and finish freezing.
I just ended up leaving mine overnight.
The next day it was utter frozen yogurt perfection.
Its rich, its creamy, its tangy .
.
.
like the kind of yummy that makes you question why you ever thought it wasnt as good as ice cream.
Feel free to use this as a base for other flavor extracts or additions.
I think it would be awesome with a cup of fruit added to emphasize that tanginess like peaches or berries or mangoes or chocolate.



Cut the chilled butter into 1 cm dice.
Put the flour and the cut up butter from step 1 into a bowl, and combine the butter and flour with your hands.
Don't knead the butter, just flatten the pieces.
The butter pieces should become about half their original size.
Add the chilled water and salt, and mix up roughly with a rubber spatula.
Bring the dough together into one lump with your hands.
There should still be visible lumps of butter and the dough should be quite floury.
Form the dough into a rectangle that's about 1 cm thick, cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for more then 2 hours.
Fold the dough.
Put the dough on a work surface, dust with flour and roll the dough out with a rolling pin while pressing down on it.
Roll out to about a thickness of 5 mm.
Fold the dough into thirds.
Fold up the side closest to you first, and adjust the sides so that the folded part covers the dough beneath it to the edge.
Fold down the far side of the dough too, and adjust to form a neat rectangle.
Turn the dough 90 degrees, and repeat the same thing again, starting from the rolling out.
Wrap the dough and keep in the refrigerator for more than an hour.
Repeat this procedure (folding into thirds and rolling out) more times, for a total of 6 times.
The finished dough should be shinly and pale in color.
Done.
You can transform this pastry dough into all kinds of sweets.
Try making some apple pie with it!
Here's another kind with larger apple pieces.
The pie crust dough will keep in the freezer for 1 month.
However, the quick-pie crust dough won't puff up as much after a while, so try to use it up as soon as possible.

Working quickly, using a tablespoon to generously spoon pralines onto the prepared pans.
Ideally, the pecans will be piled on top of one another and the sugar will spread slightly.
(If you allow your mixture to cool too much before portioning out, your candies will not spread as much, if at all, though they will still taste the samethey just might not look as pretty.)
Allow candies to cool and harden at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before removing from pan.
Pralines will keep, in an airtight container, for up to 1 week.

All measurements are by weight.
If you don't have a scale, here are alternative measurements:
Bread flour - 3 cups
Salt - 2 1/2 teaspoons
Yeast - 1/4 oz package of Rapid Rise Yeast (If you use this type, you will NOT have to mix with warm water first.)
Water - 1 1/2 cups
Ok, now for the bread.
Put the flour in a bowl.
Add the salt and mix thoroughly.
Add yeast and mix thoroughly.
Add water and mix until incorporated.
(Your hands will work fine for this.)
Cover the bowl and let rise for for 20 minutes.
Fold the dough:
Scrape dough into floured surface.
Pick up top edge and stretch/pull/fold the dough down about 2/3 and pat down.
Pull the bottom edge up to the top of the fold and pat.
Pull one side over 2/3 and pat.
Pull other side to the edge of the fold and pat.
Place back in bowl and cover.
Allow to rise another 20 minutes.
Fold dough again.
Notice that the gluten is starting to develop nicely and the dough is smoothing out.
Allow to rise another 20 minutes.
Fold one last time.
Notice the gluten has developed further.
This is how we get away without a mixer or kneading the dough a lot.
(Actually, kneading/mixing french too much makes for poorer bread.)
Allow to rise for 2 hours.
This is a good time for that nap you've been wanting.
Divide the bread.
This will make 28 ounces of dough.
Which is about 10 rolls, 2 baguettes, 3 boules, or 1 sandwich loaf.
Today I will be making some rolls, a boule, and and will figure some other shape for the rest, maybe a peasant/batard sort of thing.
So that's three pieces of dough: 1/2, 2/3 of the other half, and the scrap.
Ball or boule the pieces of dough, place on a floured surface, cover and allow to rise for 40 minute.
Cut the rolls into 5 pieces, shape into balls, place on a cornmeal dusted cookie sheet.
(DO NOT use cornmeal mix, it has baking powder, flour, and salt added and will burn.
You can use rice flour if cornmeal is not available in your area.)
Ball up the boule now and place on a heavily cornmealed surface.
Shape the scrap too.
Cover and allow to rise until doubled.
This will depend on the temp in your kitchen, but will be around 1 hour for the boule, 40 minutes or so for the scrap, and 25 minutes for the rolls.
The temperature today here is 87F, so I won't be waiting that long.
Preheat oven to 450F.
Preheat a baker's stone or cookie sheet as well.
Just put it in and turn it on.
If you use a cookie sheet, you will need to watch for burning with the boule and scrap.
For those of you that didn't check out my profile, I live off grid.
For now, my oven consists of a Coleman camp stove with a Coleman camp oven.
I'm putting up pics so you can see that even with meager equipment, you can make good bread.
Slice the top of the rolls with a knife or razor blade and bake until brown, or an internal temp of 180F - 200F
Slice, or score, the tops of the boule and scrap, use a turner to transfer to the stone and bake until hollow sounding when thumped on the bottom, or 200F internal temp.
Cool on a wire rack.
