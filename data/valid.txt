Rinse the soy beans, and soak them in plenty of water overnight.
They will swell up to twice their size by the next day.
Put the soy beans into twice their volume of water in a pressure cooker and bring to a boil.
Skim off the white scum that rises to the surface.
Put the perforated metal plate that comes with the pressure cooker on top.
Lock the lid on and cook under pressure for 10 minutes, then leave to cool down naturally.
*If you have a small pressure cooker, cook the soy beans in 2 batches.
This is the fresh rice koji I ordered by mail and used this time.
There are 2 bags containing 1.3 kg each.
You can use dried rice koji instead!
While the soy beans are cooking, mix the koji and salt together.
Drain the cooking liquid from the cooked soy beans, and hold onto it to use later.
*If you're cooking the soy beans in several batches, just keep the cooking liquid from the final batch.
Let the soy beans cool a bit, and put them in a plastic bag.
They'll be hot so wrap the bag in a towel and press down with your hands to mash them.
The beans are very soft so this should be easy.
Add the combined koji and salt from Step 5 to the mashed soy beans and mix well.
Mix in some of the cooking liquid until the paste is about the consistency of hamburger mixture or about as soft as your earlobe.
Line a large container or tub with a double layer of plastic bags.
Roll the paste into apple sized balls (these are called miso balls) and throw them hard into the container.
Press them in firmly to eliminate any air pockets.
When all the miso balls have been put into the container, press down hard on the whole mass again while putting your weight into it to remove any air.
Sprinkle a handful of salt on top evenly.
(This is to prevent the surface from developing mold.)
Squeeze the inner plastic bag closed while pushing out any air inside.
Press a small lid or plate on top, add a weight on top of that and wrap and close the outer plastic bag over all.
Cover with a lid.
Wrap the whole container with another plastic bag.
Leave it in a dark, cool place out of the sun.
Here's the schedule from this point on:
Mixing up from the bottom (1st time): Check on the miso after about 2 months to see if it has developed any mold!
If it has, just remove the parts with the mold.
Mix the whole thing up from the bottom after removing the moldy parts.
Mixing up from the bottom (2nd time): Open up the miso 4 months after the first time you mixed it up!
Mix it up from the bottom again.
If the miso has matured enough when you mix it up the 2nd time you can start eating it, but it will become more delicious if you let it mature for a while longer.
I made miso this time on February 3rd, the day of spring (Setsubun no Hi).
I'm looking forward to how it will turn out.
April 30th: The first mixing up!
It's about 3 months after I made the miso.
I opened the lid slowly since I was afraid it had developed mold.
Looks so good!
It's fluffy, and actually starting to smell like miso!
It hadn't molded at all as I'd feared, and it's turned into miso.
It's not yet edible at this point, though.
I mixed it up from the bottom.
To do this I took the plastic bag out and squeezed the miso over the bag.
This way my hands are not in direct contact with the miso, so no bacteria gets into it.
I returned the plastic bag to the container, and levelled out the surface with a wooden spatula.
I closed up the plastic bags again as described above.
I left it in a cool, dark place.
I'll check on it again in September...maybe it will be ready to eat by then...
End of August: It's matured into a delicious looking miso.
It's ready to eat at this point.
The top photo is of the miso at this stage.

To avoid grease splatters on the top of your stove or having to wash an extra splatter screen, simply put bacon in a cast iron skillet with the lid on in a preheated 450* oven for about 15 minutes.
Remove the skillet, drain the bacon, and the oven stays clean and so does the top of your stove.
Enjoy now and/or you can crumble up the leftover bacon to use in omelets or other recipes for later.
Simply put them in a freezer bag and use later.
It's especially efficient when you've already heated the oven for another dish.



Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-x-15 1/2-x-1/2-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end.
Batter: Pour the cream, corn syrup, and sugar into a 1 1/2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan.
Stir to combine, then add the butter.
Stir over medium-low heat until the butter melts.
Then raise the heat to medium, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon--especially toward the end of cooking--to prevent scorching.
Cook until the mixture reaches 238 degrees F, the soft-ball stage, on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes; the mixture will appear between ivory- and straw-colored.
Remove from heat, and stir in almonds.
Pour the mixture onto the center of the foil-lined baking sheet, and spread it in as thin a layer as possible.
A pool about 8 inches in diameter is fine.
Bake for 3 minutes; then spread the more liquid mixture evenly over the baking sheet.
If the mixture still does not completely cover the baking sheet, bake another minute, then tilt the baking sheet to allow the mixture to spread evenly.
Bake for about 5 to 6 minutes total, or until golden but not dark brown.
Though the mixture bubbles while baking, the bubbles form more slowly toward the end of baking time than at the beginning.
Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
While the mixture is still warm but no longer liquid, cut 1 1/2-inch squares using a ruler and a pastry wheel.
If the mixture is too warm, it will not cut cleanly.
If it is too cool, it will splinter or not cut; in that case return it to the oven for a few seconds to soften it a bit.
Decoration: When the squares are completely cool, place the chocolate in a bowl over water at about 120 degrees F. When about two-thirds of the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the water.
With a dry rubber spatula, stir until the liquid chocolate melts the soft or unmelted chocolate that remains.
Fill a small handmade paper cone with the chocolate and snip off the tip.
Pipe thin lines of chocolate back and forth over the squares' surface.
Refrigerate the squares briefly, just to set the chocolate.
Remove from the refrigerator and set aside in a cool, dry place.
To store, remove squares from the foil and place them in layers, separated by strips of aluminum, in an airtight metal or plastic container in a cool place up to 1 week.

Dough Starter:.
In a mixer bowl combine the 1 cup bread flour,1/4 cup wheat flour, 1/2 tsp yeast, honey and water.
Whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Scrape down bowl.
Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap.
Let ferment at room temperature for 1 hour up to 4 hours.Starter will have bubbled up and risen in the bowl.
Flour Mixture:.
Combine the 1 3/4 cups bread flour and the yeast.
Add to the risen sponge in the mixing bowl.Do not add salt at this time.
With the dough hook installed mix on low speed (# 2 on a Kitchenaid) for about one minute until you have a rough dough.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Sprinkle on the salt at this stage and knead with dough hook (#4 speed) for about 7 minutes.
Instant read thermometer plunged into the center should read 78 to 80 degrees.
The dough should be very elastic, smooth and slightly sticky;If too sticky,add a little flour up to 1/4 cup.
You can knead in any extra flour by hand after you remove the dough from the bowl.
Let the dough rise in an oiled covered bowl until double at room temperature.
Press the dough down, fold it over and let rise again for another l hour.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
The dough may be formed into a ball or,placed in an 8 X 4 greased bread pan or rolled out to an oblong loaf.
Free form loaves should be placed on a cookie sheet that has been sprinkled with flour or cornmeal.
Cover the shaped dough and allow it to double.
The freeform oblong loaf should be 8" by 3"inches high.
In the loaf pan the center should be 1" higher then the sides of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 475 1 hour before baking.
Adjust oven shelf to lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it before preheating the oven.
At this stage I like to mist the loaf with water and roll it in sesame seeds, poppy seeds or other whole grains.
Slash freeform bread diagonally with a sharp knife or razor blade making 1/2" deep slices.
If using a loaf pan, make 1 slash down the center or leave unslashed.
Bake for 10 minutes at 475 then turn oven down to 425 and continue to bake for 20 to 30 minutes more or until Instant Read Thermometer reads about 200 degrees.
Cover halfway through baking if loaf becomes too brown.
Let bread cool thoroughly before slicing.

Pour the pretzels in a medium bowl and crush them with your hands to one-quarter of their original size.
Add the milk powder, malt powder, sugar, and salt and toss to mix.
Add the butter and toss to coat.
As you toss, the butter will act as glue, binding the dry ingredients to the pretzels and creating small clusters.
3.
Spread the clusters on a parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes, at which point they should look toasted, smell buttery, and crunch gently when cooled slightly and chewed.
4.
Cool the pretzel crunch completely before storing or using in a recipe.
Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, the crunch will keep fresh for 1 week; in the fridge or freezer, it will keep for 1 month.

Once warm add powdered milk and the 4 cups of milk and stir untill everything is dissolved.
Add in your flavoring and/or Fruit.
At this point it shuld be just realy warm, if it is hot and you cannot hold your hand on the bottom of the pan, wait until it has cooled to room temperature.
Pour in to ice cream maker or place in freezer.
If your using a freezer once it starts to freeze on the sides of the pan stir with a eggbeater every 30 min about 4 times total.
Once it has set up use a single eggbeater to grind it up after a couple of these sessions followed by refreezing it will be ice cream.
Or if you use a ice cream maker it will be done when set up normally for that maker.

Cover the bowl and put in a warm place overnight.
(the author's last batch took 18 hours) By warm, I mean 70-80F
As the time approaches, it should smell good not like rotting milk, but like delicious creme fraiche.
Which is what you are making at this point.
When its ready, it will thicken to something like sour cream thickness (of course!).
It will smell like heaven and taste just as good.
Now bring the cream to a temperature of around 60F.
At this point, put the cream into the bowl of a stand mixer, and stir at medium low speed with the paddle attachment.
Do not use high speed, because if you do, when the cream turns to butter, you will have a mess all over your walls.
The slow stirring will do the trick.
Watch it.
If you have 60F cream, and its ripened nicely, it may become butter in as quickly as five minutes.
But it could take quite a bit longer, too.
Watch and you will see it become creamier, creamier, a bit grainy...
Butter grains floating in buttermilk.
When the grains are about rice-sized, drain the buttermilk (you can cook with it, or use it as starter for another batch).
Rinse the butter under cold running water, working the butter by kneading it, squeezing and pressing and folding, and rinsing until the water runs clear.
If you dont do this, your butter will go rancid quickly.
Then keep working the butter to get as much water out of it as you can.
This is when you can add salt, which helps it to keep longer.
You should have about a pound of butter after you are done working it.
I divide it into fourths and freeze all but one, which is the one we will use right away.
The cultured butter will have a stronger butter flavor than you are used to, and you will want to spread it on everything.
Be warned.

Measure out about 1 dry cup of dried adzuki beans.
You will probably have leftover, adzuki beans definitely multiply when cooked.
Soak the beans overnight.
Next day, bring about 4-5 cups of water to a boil, then let the beans simmer for 35-40 minutes or until soft, with the pot lid loosely covered.
Drain the beans, and measure out 2 cups now that they're cooked.
(Save the leftover beans for veggie burger or roasting purposes, or other adzuki confections!
).
Put the cooked beans and 1 1/2 cups of sugar plus a little water into a food processor and puree it until there are almost no more bean pieces left.
Pour the paste into a colander fitted over a large bowl, and let strain overnight (at least 6-8 hours.
).
When it's all done straining the next day, there should be a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl and the paste inside the colander should be nice and thick.
It's ready for use now!
It can be refridgerated for up to a week, then frozen for a few months for future use.



The berries are ripest when they have turned from red to black.
Since they ripen one by one, pick and store them in the refrigerator.
Once you collect enough, you can make the jam.
I had a lot of small, firm blackberries, so I put them in the blender for 5 seconds and then strained them through a strainer.
Even after doing that, they still had some seeds.
If that bothers you, use a cheesecloth to strain again.
Place the strained berries into a pot.
Add 40-50% the weight of the berries in sugar, and turn the heat on to low.
Bring it to a slow simmer and occasionally remove any scum that rises to the top.
Stir the berries occasionally to prevent sticking and clumping.
Just before it has become the consistency that you want, add the lemon juice and stop the heat.
Once cooled, place in a sterilized jar.
This can keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

Work in the butter until the mixture is crumbly; some larger, pea-sized pieces of butter may remain intact.
Add the milk or buttermilk, stirring to make a sticky dough.
Drop the dough in heaping tablespoonfuls atop the syrup in the pan.
A tablespoon cookie scoop, slightly overfilled, works well here.
Bake the biscuits on the middle rack of the oven for 10 minutes.
Turn the oven off, and leave them in the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until they're golden brown.
Remove the biscuits from the oven, and IMMEDIATELY turn the pan over onto a serving plate.
If you leave the biscuits sitting in the pan after you remove it from the oven, the bacon/maple topping will start to set up and it will be difficult to get it out of the pan.
Lift off the pan, and scrape any syrup left in the pan onto the biscuits.
Pull biscuits apart to serve.

Store any leftover mix in an airtight container.



Melt and stir together chocolate chips and milk in a double boiler over low heat (or use your microwave); add butter and stir briefly until it is melted; remove from heat; cover and refrigerate four hours or overnight.
Form chocolate mixture into small balls using a teaspoon and your fingers; the mixture will seem stiff at first but the heat from your fingers will soften it.
Roll truffles in your choice of cocoa powder, chopped nuts (hazelnuts would be a good choice as they are popular in Switzerland), powdered sugar, finely shredded coconut, chocolate sprinkles, or in melted and slightly cooled milk chocolate or white chocolate.
Store truffles in the refrigerator for up to one week.



Make the cookie base: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the butter in a food processor, along with the flour, light brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
Pulse until the mixture is well combined (about 20 pulses).
Scatter the dough into a 9x9-inch baking pan and press it evenly over the bottom.
(Wipe out the processor bowl but don&#8217;t bother washing it.)

When the cookie base comes out of the oven, sprinkle the grated chocolate evenly over the top.
(Don&#8217;t turn off the oven.)
Set the pan aside.
Make the pecan topping: As the cookie base bakes, pulse the pecans in the food processor until coarsely chopped.
In a medium-size heavy saucepan, melt the butter.
Stir in the dark brown sugar, honey, cream, and salt.
Simmer for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the pecans.
Pour the pecan mixture over the chocolate-sprinkled cookie base, spreading evenly.
Bake until much of the filling is bubbling (not just the edges), 16 to 18 minutes.
Let cool completely in the pan.
When ready to serve, cut into 16 squares.
Tightly covered, these bars will keep for about five days (though they never last that long).



Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes and freeze for 10 minutes (not more).
You can mix with your hands or with a hand-held pastry blender, but I prefer a food processor for ease.
Process flour, salt and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds.
Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, about ten one-second pulses.
Using fork, mix sour cream and 1/3 cup ice water in small bowl until combined.
Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse for three 1-second pulses.
Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture.
Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry and does not hold together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water (start with less), and process until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, three to five 1-second pulses.
Divide dough into two balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk; wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not too hard, 1 to 2 hours, before rolling.
(Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.
Let thoroughly chilled dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.
Dough can also be frozen.
I usually make at least one extra recipe's worth, form the dough into pie pans, then freeze for later use.
Just thaw before using!

ITS A CRISPY CHEESY PARMESAN GREAT AS A SIDE ,



Pop the popcorn the way you normally would.
If you have never made homemade popcorn, place 1 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil into a pan that has a lid.
I wouldnt use a non-stick pan.
Turn stove-top on medium high and place 2 kernels in the pan with the oil.
Wait until you hear them pop.
Once they have popped place the remaining popcorn kernels into the pan and move it around so all of the oil gets onto the kernels.
Once popcorn starts popping pick up the pan slightly and in a rotating motion make small circles over stove top burner.
Once the popcorn stops popping or slows down to 1 or 2 pops per couple seconds remove pan from heat and immediately place popped popcorn into 2 large microwave safe bowls (while you do this, remove all kernels that did not pop).
You should place popcorn into each bowl so that they are only halfway full.
*If there is leftover popcorn, it is okay.
Just set it aside in another bowl.
You can toss the leftovers into one of the 2 bowls once you have finished the process.
You just need to make sure that you have plenty of room in the bowls to work.
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
To make the caramel melt the butter over medium heat in a medium sauce pan.
Once all the butter is melted add in the corn syrup and brown sugar.
Stirring frequently, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
Once the mixture starts to boil, stop stirring and let the mixture boil for 4-5 minutes making sure to not burn it.
You want an amber color brownso make sure to watch it.
Once the caramel has boiled for 4-5 minutes or has turned amber in color, remove pan from the heat.
Stir in the baking soda and vanilla.
The mixture will start to bubble, this is normal.
Preheat oven to 250 F.
Pour the caramel sauce equally over the popcorn in the bowls and toss to coat evenly.
Remember if you have leftover popcorn make sure to estimate dividing the caramel into thirds, not halves.
I started off using a big salad spoon to toss the mixture.
Then once the caramel cooled down a bit I used my fingers and hands to toss the rest.
Spread the tossed popcorn onto the 2 baking sheets.
*Even if you had to toss a third bowl of popcorn it should all fit on the 2 baking sheets.
Bake for 40-50 minutes, removing the popcorn from the oven every 10 minutes to toss and stir.
After 40 minutes, remove the pans from the oven.
Pull out a piece of popcorn, let it cool completely and try it.
If it is not crispy, stick the sheets of popcorn back into the oven for another 10 minutes.
After 50 minutes maximum, take popcorn out of the oven and place the pans on wire racks to cool.
Once completely cooled break caramel corn into pieces and serve.

Place water and barley in a 1 1/2 quart pot.
Bring to a boil.
Let boil until liquid is reduced by half, approximately 10 to 15 minutes, which allows the natural sugars to come out of the barley.
The remaining liquid should be brown.
Drain the barley, saving the liquid, and either eat the cooked barley or throw away (it's only 2 tablespoons).
Return the liquid to the pot and add up to 2 tablespoon sugar, or other sweetner of choice.
Simmer the liquid for about 15 minutes.
If you want, at the end of simmering for 15 minutes, add up to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (although, for me personally, adding lemon juice would just get in the way of the barley flavor).

MANUAL METHOD: In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir till the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, oil your hands, and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to become smooth and supple.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise till puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.
Gently fold the dough in upon itself and turn it upside-down after 30 minutes; this "turn" helps eliminate some of the excess carbon dioxide and redistributes the yeast's food, both imperative for optimum yeast growth.
MIXER METHOD: Combine the ingredients as directed at left, using a flat beater paddle or beaters, then switch to the dough hook(s) and knead for 5 to 8 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise, with a turn, as directed above.
BREAD MACHINE METHOD: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for Manual or Dough, and press Start.
Examine the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, and adjust its consistency with additional water or flour as needed, to produce a smooth, supple dough.
Allow the machine to complete its cycle.
Divide the dough into six pieces, and shape each piece into a rough log.
Let the logs rest for 15 minutes, covered, then shape each piece into a smooth batard shape (a log about 8 inches long, slightly tapered at each end).

Makes about 5 ounces.
1.
In a large jar with a tight fitting lid, add cold cream and salt.
I used a quart-sized mason jar.
You want your jar to be big enough for the cream to move around loosely.
2.
Tighten lid securely and get ready to shake your brains out.
I mean, really shake that sucker.
This is a great time to get your cardio and arm workout done.
Or grab a friend and take turns shaking until you can shake no longer.
You will want to shake your jar for a total of 25 minutes.
3.
At about 4 or so minutes in, you will definitely hear a difference in your cream.
It will take on a deep thick sound.
At about 8 1/2 minutes in it will be almost too thick to shake anymore.
If you take a peek, youll see that youve made whipped cream.
Keep going!
4.
At about 14 1/2 minutes you will definitely see a separation.
Keep shaking that baby!
20 minutes in and your butter will separate completely.
Youll hear a sort of plop sound!
Youre looking for the butterfat to become solid (i.e.
the butter!)
and completely separate from the liquid (i.e.
the buttermilk)!
Cool, huh?
Give your jar another 2-5 minutes of shaking at this point, just to really release all the solids from the liquid.
5.
Once your butter has formed, get out a bowl and place a fine mesh strainer on top.
Pour out all the contents from your jar.
Save that liquid/buttermilk!
Use it in cereals, granola, smoothies, or just drink as is.
6.
Gently press out any remaining liquid from the butter as best you can and then add butter to a container with a tight fitting lid.
Store in the fridge for up to a week and use it exactly as you would butter from the store.

Pour the liquid mixture into an ice cube tray, then stick a few blueberries into each of the compartments.
Theyll end up suspended in the middle after the liquid freezes.
Put a toothpick or popsicle stick into each while they freeze and you can enjoy the fruit drops straight up, or skip the sticks and use them in beverages.
Either way, these fruit drops are a treat for the eyes, and great for people with mouth sores or anyone who wants to stay hydrated.

As the dried cranberries soak with the mustard and vinegar, their bright red color leaches out into the vinegar.
The resulting mustard is a pretty, cranberry-tinted pink.
In a non-aluminum pot or jar, combine the mustard seeds, vinegar and cranberries; cover and soak for 48 hours, adding additional vinegar if necessary to maintain enough liquid to cover the seeds.
Scrape the soaked seed-and-cranberry mixture into a food processor and process until the mixture turns from liquid and seeds to a creamy mixture flecked with seeds and bits of cranberry.
Add honey and salt.
The process takes at least 3 to 4 minutes, so be patient.
You may need to add additional vinegar as necessary to create a nice creamy mustard; keep in mind that it will thicken slightly upon standing.
After about one week of aging, the cranberry flavor seems to settle into this mustard and make it all the better, but it is perfectly good immediately.

Optional- As mentioned above, I like a cream cheese version of this frosting best.
The cream cheese adds to the creamy texture, and cuts down on the sweetness just a bit.
If desired, for a very light cream cheese flavor add 1/2 block (4 oz).
cream cheese, leaving the other ingredients (as listed above) the same.
For a more traditional cream cheese flavor, reduce the butter to 1/2 cup, and add 1 block (8 oz.)
of cream cheese.
If using a full block of cream cheese, you can reduce the cream or milk to 1 tablespoon total.
Flavoring options- An almost unlimited number of flavoring options can be added in addition to, or instead of the vanilla.
Orange and/or lemon zest, citrus extracts, mint extract, coconut extract or the seeds of a vanilla bean are all wonderful options.
In most cases Ill still add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, then 1/2 teaspoon of the other flavoring.
For zest, add about 1 teaspoon fresh zest.
For chocolate buttercream, add 1/2 cup (good quality) unsweetened cocoa powder.
Directions-.
* In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, beat butter (on medium speed) until completely smooth (30 seconds to a minute).
(If you are adding cream cheese, add it now, then beat until smooth).
* Add salt (if needed).
* One cup at time, add 2 cups of powdered sugar, beating after each addition.
* Add vanilla, or other flavorings and beat to combine.
* Add about 1 tablespoon of cream, and continue beating.
* Add the remaining 2 cups powdered sugar, one at a time.
* Add an additional 1-2 tablespoons cream until desired consistency is reached.
If you want to pipe the frosting on cupcakes, the frosting should be nice and thick.
Continue to beat another minute or so.
The frosting should now be smooth and fluffy.
Troubleshooting-.
* If your frosting is not smooth, it is likely because the butter was not fully smooth before adding the other ingredients.
* If your frosting will not hold up when piped on cupcakes, your frosting has too much liquid or is too warm.
Put entire bowl of frosting in the fridge for 15-20 minutes and it will stiffen up.
If it is still too thin, then add 1/4 to 1/2 cup powdered sugar, beat well.

Mixing: I.
In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir till the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl.
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, oil your hands, and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it begins to become smooth and supple.
(You may also knead this dough in an electric mixer or food processor, or in a bread machine programmed for "dough" or "manual.")
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise till puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 minutes, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.
Shaping:
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and shape it into an 8-inch log.
Place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, cover the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the bread to rise for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1 inch above the edge of the pan.
A finger pressed into the dough should leave a mark that rebounds slowly.
Baking:
Bake the bread in a preheated 350F oven for about 40 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after 20 minutes.
Test it for doneness by removing it from the pan and thumping it on the bottom (it should sound hollow), or measuring its interior temperature with an instant-read thermometer (it should register 190F at the center of the loaf).
Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a wire rack before slicing.
Store the bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.

If the temperature in your house drops to 60F overnight, warm the casserole in the evening on slowest possible heat for about 10-15 minutes.
After 48 hours (possibly up to 72) the milk will have kefir's consistency and smell.
Put the casserole on the slowest possible heat for about 60-75 minutes.
The contents of the casserole should warm up to 140F but not higher.
At this stage a white lump should separate itself completely from a clean liquid.
Drain the liquid.
You may preserve it (this is milk whey) to use in breads and pancakes.
Tie the lump in a cheesecloth, put it on a strainer, put the strainer to hang over the empty casserole and put a small lid with a weight over the cheesecloth for the complete draining.
Put the casserole with all the stuff into the refrigerator for 8-12 hours.
The longer you keep it there the drier it gets (personal preference matters).

Put the ingredients in a bread maker, and start the "dough" course.
After 5 minutes of kneading, add the olive oil.
When the dough is made...
...divide into 3 portions, and roll each into balls.
Place the balls seam side down, cover with a tightly wrung out kitchen towel, and rest the dough for 15 minutes.
Carefully press the air out while rolling out the dough with a rolling pin.
If the dough is sticky, gently scrape it off the work surface with a dough scraper.
Fold both sides of flaps so that they overlap.
Gently press down the dough with your hands to flatten it a little bit.
Roll it up from the bottom.
Close the seam completely, and place it seam side down.
Form all 3 portions of dough in the same way.
Grease the bread pan, and put the dough in.
Let the dough rise at 35 ~ 40C until the pieces double in size .
I let them rise until the dough rose to 1cm to 1.5cm above the rim of the pan this time.
Preheat the oven to 230C.
Turn down the oven temperature from 230C to 200C, and bake the loaf in the oven for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature for 180C and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
If the dough is not cooking evenly, turn the pan.
When the bread is baked, drop the bread pan from a height of 30 cm onto a work surface to 'shock' it.
Immediately remove the bread from the pan to cool.
If your oven has a thermometer inside, it's useful.
Gas oven and electronic oven cook differently, so it's good to have a thermometer.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat peanut butter and butter until creamy and smooth.
Gradually add in vanilla extract and powdered sugar with the mixture on low, speeding up once it becomes more combined.

Some of the balls will have crisped rice edges sticking out and some may be crumbly.
Thats okay, just roll as smooth as you can, occasionally squeezing the dough together if needed.
Refrigerate for 60-90 minutes.
Melt chocolate in either the microwave (I melt in 30-second increments while stirring) or in a double boiler.

Makes about 20 truffles.
Lastsfor about a week covered in the refrigerator and freezes well, too.
Carl's
Comments: I prefer the melon baller because it makes such uniformly round shapes.
I also use the walnuts rather than cocoa pwdr, smashing the walnuts till they are about the same size as finely minced garlic.
Don't attempt to operate a motor vehicle or possibly use heavy equipment after scarfing a plate of these!
!
Serving Suggestion: Open a bottle of your finest Cabernet to make the truffles.
Vacu-Vin the bottle and save it to accompany the truffles when they're ready to eat.
This is one of the greatest taste treats of the century, folks.
Also try adding some thin slices of asiago cheese along with some apple, pear, and nectarine slices to your serving plate!

Put whey protein into a bowl and add water.
Work it together, it's ok if it doesn't all combine, it should be sort of pasty with a bit of powder, but try to mix together as much as possible.
Set aside.
Pour syrup into a microwavable bowl and microwave on high for 30-40 seconds, until it just softens up a bit.
Stir in the peanut butter and mix together.
It shouldn't be too hot, if it is let it sit just a bit until it's just warm.
Whey protein does not combine well with really hot substances.
Stir into the whey and combine.
You should be able to dissolve any remaining powder into the peanut butter/syrup mixture, and you've got a very sticky mixture now, so be careful!
Either fold the oats into the mixture if your bowl is big enough, or put the oats into a big bowl/pot and add the whey protein/peanut butter/syrup mixture to it with a spatula.
After adding the oats, you should knead it into a solid ball, before pressing it into a pan.
Let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and cut into bars.
Note: whey protein can be substituted for soy protein, making the product vegan and non-dairy, though you may need to add a bit of additional sweetener.
Can also be done without a microwave, you just might have to put a bit more muscle into combining the peanut butter and syrup.

Notes on how to make STELLAR biscuits:.
1) Spoon flour into a dry measuring cup and level off with the straight edge of a metal knife.
DON'T use a liquid measuring cup or you'll end up with too much flour and rock hard biscuits!
2) I find it easier to incorporate room-temperature butter into my dry ingredients but then put the bowl with flour/butter back into the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to chill the mixture.
The colder your butter is, the higher your biscuits will end up.
If you want to work with cold butter, this step is NOT necessary.
3) Shake the carton of buttermilk before measuring and make sure the buttermilk is COLD!
It keeps the butter cold, and you have a lighter, fluffier biscuit.
4) Dust the work surface with All-Purpose flour when rolling and shaping the dough.
(Leavening in Self-Rising flour leaves a bitter taste on the outside of the biscuit.
).
5) Cut STRAIGHT DOWN with a sharp biscuit cutter!
Do NOT twist the cutter or you'll be sealing the edges of the biscuits and reduce the rise of them.
Ditto on using a glass to cut out biscuits: both sides of the cutter need to be open to allow air to exit as you press down.
The glass ends up sealing the edges of the biscuit.
Directions:.
Preheat oven to 450-degrees F.
In a very large bowl combine all the dry ingredients: Flour, Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Sugar, Salt, Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper.
Stir well to evenly distribute the ingredients.
Drop the cut tablespoons of butter all around the flour mixture.
Cut in butter using a pastry cutter until mixture is about the size of peas or very crumbly.
Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to allow the butter to become hard; this will aid in having a very flaky biscuit.
Add the cheese chunks and chives to the chilled butter/flour mixture.
Stir to coat them well with the flour.
Stir in buttermilk only until dough holds together very slightly, about 30 seconds.
DO NOT OVER STIR!
THIS IS THE SECRET TO INCREDIBLY FLUFFY AND LIGHT BISCUITS!
The dough should "hold together" but still be very lofty and NOT packed down!
Turn dough out onto a floured board, kneading dough a few times (about 3-4 times) and then pat into a 5-inch x 9-inch rectangle; Sprinkle top of dough with a small amount of additional flour and fold into thirds like a letter.
Repeat entire process 2 more times, beginning with pressing into a 3/4" inch-thick dough rectangle again.
Press or pat dough into a 1/2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface; Dip edges of 2.5-inch biscuit cutter into flour and cut out a biscuit.DO NOT TWIST THE CUTTER!
JUST PRESS FIRMLY DOWN, ONCE.
Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, placing biscuits side by side so they touch.
Continue with existing dough.
With the scraps, very lightly press dough together to form another rectangle and continue cutting out the biscuits.
Caution!
The MORE you work the dough and manhandle it, the tougher your biscuits will become so work with a very light hand when pushing the dough back together.
Brush tops of biscuits lightly with cream.
Bake for 14-16 minutes or until biscuits are lightly browned.
Take out of oven by sliding the parchment paper with biscuits attached, onto table or counter top.
Allow to sit for ONLY 1 minute, and transfer to a wire rack to cool for only a couple of minutes before serving.
Caution!
Moisture really builds up on the bottom of these biscuits, which is why they only sit on the parchment paper for 1 minute.
Cooling on the rack for 2-3 minutes allows the cheese to set enough that it does NOT burn a person's mouth when eating it!
VARIATIONS ON BISCUITS:.
1) Feta-Oregano or Marjoram: Stir 4-8 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of either oregano or marjoram into the chilled butter/flour mixture before adding the buttermilk.
Proceed with recipe as directed.
2) Bacon-Cheddar: Stir 6 cooked, drained, cooled and crumbled slices of bacon into the chilled butter/flour mixture along with 1/2 a cup of cubed Cheddar Cheese.
Omit chives.
Proceed with recipe as directed.
3) Gruyere-Rosemary: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Gruyere cheese and 1/2 tablespoon of fresh, snipped rosemary into the chilled butter/flour mixture.
Use 1/4 cup of snipped chives and 1/2 tablespoon of freshly ground black peper.
Proceed with recipe as directed.
4) Havarti-Dill: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Havarti cheese with 1 tablespoon of freshly snipped dill into the chilled butter/flour mixture.
Omit chives.
Proceed with recipe as directed.
5) Pimento Cheese: Stir in 1 cup cubed Sharp Cheddar Cheese with 1-4 ounce jar of DRAINED and patted dry Pimento into the chilled butter/flour mixture.
Omit chives.
Proceed with recipe as directed.
6) The ONE failure that I had was with Pepperjack Cheese.
The actual cheese is too mild to taste in the end results and the remaining hot peppers were too much for the biscuit.
Avoid this combination!

NOTE: The whole young coconuts generally come with the husks trimmed down, so they sit flat with a pointed top.
To open these coconuts, a cleaver is your best bet.
You can use a chefs knife, but if you do, make sure its an old, inexpensive one!
Lay the coconut on its side, securing it so that it wont roll Try not to hold the fruit with your free hand while you make the first cut (in case you have particularly bad aim!).
Holding the knife high, bring it down sharply near the top of the coconut.
The knife should sink in about 1/3 of the way, breaking through the inner shell.
Quickly set the coconut upright so as not to lose the water to the cutting board.
If you didnt succeed in breaking the inner shell, rotate the shell and try the technique again.
Drain the coconut of its water into a blender or bowl, then use the cleaver or knife to finish cutting off the top to get at the meat.
The meat will range from very thin and very soft (sometimes even with a pale purplish hue in very young coconuts), to thicker and firmer.
The firmer meat is best for recipes that call for noodles or pasta squares.
Sometimes you have to open a few before you get one with nice firm meat, but the soft meat is perfectly good for sauces and smoothies, and coconut meat freezes beautifully, so all of it is good to use.
The best way to get the firmer meat out is by using the back of a spoon to pry it from the sides of the coconut, then trim away any of the shell residue with a paring knife.
Lay the pieces of coconut flat on a cutting board and slice into 1/6 inch strips for dishes that call for coconut noodles.

Toast the fennel seeds in a small saute pan over medium heat, shaking a few times for even toasting, until they become aromatic and start to brown slightly.
Be careful that they dont burn.
Let cool slightly, then pulse a couple of times in a spice grinder or clean coffee grinder, just until the fennel is broken up a bit.
Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the lemon juice, agave nectar, shallot, and salt.
Slowly pour in the olive oil, whisking all the while, and continue whisking until smooth.
Transfer to a small container with a fitted lid and shake well.
Do a FASS check.
Depending on the type and taste of the lemons, you may want to add a teaspoon of olive oil or a pinch of salt.
Goes with My Familys Favorite Chicken (page 111), as a marinade.
It also makes a good marinade for fish and is wonderful drizzled over roasted asparagus and other vegetables.
Although toasting the fennel seeds may seem like a time-consuming and unnecessary step, I assure you that it isnt.
Toasting unleashes the natural oils of the fennel seeds, coaxing out their tremendous flavor and healing properties.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days.

Delicious!



Before you begin canning, its important that you first get properly set up.
You will need to put your canning jars in the dishwasher and run it on the hottest setting with no soap.
The purpose of this is to sterilize them, and so that you have hot jars to ladle your hot jam into to prevent cracking.
If you dont have a dishwasher, you can always boil the jars in water on the stove-top.
You will also need to fill a hot water bath (or large pot) 3/4 full with water and turn the heat to medium-high.
This will be the water that you process your jam in at the end, so if you turn the heat on now, it will be ready for you at the end of the process.
The heat from the boiling water will kill bacteria and other little nasties and it will seal the lids.
Finally, heat some water in a tiny saucepan for sterilizing your lids and rings.
You will also need a ladle, a funnel, a magnetic lid grabber and a jar grabber.
While your jars are sterilizing and your water bath is heating its time to start jamming.
Peel, pit and coarsely chop 4 cups apricots.
This is about 2 heaping quarts or 3 wimpy quarts of fresh fruit.
I like to use apricots that are very ripe.
Youll know theyre perfect if youre able to pit and break them apart with your fingers after peeling them.
Place your apricots in a medium saucepan and smash them well using a potato smasher.
Add organic cane sugar and fresh lemon juice to the saucepan and stir until combined.
Begin heating the jam on a medium-high burner with a candy thermometer clipped to the side of your pot.
Continue to heat while continuously slowly stirring the jam and while scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to keep it from burning.
Continue heating until gelling point is reached, which is 220 degrees F at most elevations.
If you live at a high elevation plan on 228 degrees F. If youre having trouble getting up to 220 degrees F you may need to turn your burner up to high heat.
Your need to do this will largely depend on your stove.
After reaching gelling point, remove the jam from the heat and allow it to cool until it stops bubbling, so that its safer to handle.
At this point youre ready to fill your jars and can or process them using the water bath method, so that they are shelf stable.
Before ladling the jam into your jars, dip your ladle and funnel into your boiling water for approximately 1 minute to ensure they are sterile.
Next, ladle the jam into the warm, sterilized canning jars that you pulled out of your dishwasher.
Be sure not to touch the insides of the jars and resist the temptation to lick your fingers throughout the process (this part will be difficult).
This will ensure that you maintain a sterile environment within the jars by the time youre done.
Next, clean the rims of your jars with a paper towel that you dipped into boiling water.
If there is jam on the rims of the jars when you place the lid on top, it can compromise the integrity of the seal.
Now youre ready to sterilize your lids in the small saucepan of hot water.
Youll want to be careful not to boil the lids, as this can damage the seals, so bring the water to a boil first, remove from the heat, and then place the lids inside.
Wait 5 minutes before using, so that the heat has time to work its bacteria-killing magic.
Next, remove the lids with the magnetic lid grabber, being sure not to touch the bottoms of the lids, and place them on the jars.
Finally, place the rings on your jars.
Now comes the tricky part you will screw the ring on until it is just tight, and then go back the other direction about one-eighth of an inch, or a couple of millimeters, loosening the ring a bit.
This is very important dont skip this step!
This will allow some air to escape the jars while youre boiling them, and then create a vacuum as they cool, sealing the jars.
Place the jars into the boiling hot water bath (or large pot) using your jar grabber.
Bring the water to a full boil, place the lid on the pot, and set your timer for 15 minutes.
After the jars have boiled (or have been processed) for 15 minutes, remove them from the pot using your grabber again and place them upright on some dish towels to cool.
Soon after the jars are removed from the pot, you should start hearing popping sounds as the jars seal.
You will need to let them rest for 24 hours, so pick a place where they wont be in the way, and wont be a temptation for little hands or curious pets.

Add salts and baking soda to a food processor and pulse several times.
Add oils, pulse again to make bath salts smaller and mix all ingredients.
Put into pretty containers (plastic most desirable around a bath tub) and use 1/4 cup in hot bath water, or more if youve had an extra stressful day!



In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt 5 or 6 times to fluff up the flour with air.
Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Do not overmix.
Add the ice water and process by pulsing until the mixture just starts to stick together (if processed too much, the dough wont be flaky).
Divide the dough in half and flatten slightly into 2 disks.
Flour the dough a little and place each disk between 2 pieces of waxed paper.
Wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or more, until ready to use.
Place 1 disk on a lightly floured surface.
Roll the dough into a circle about 2 inches larger than the pie pan.
This dough is easy to roll out thinly.
To prevent cracks or tears, lift the dough by rolling it back onto the rolling pin, then roll it over your dish.
Gently press the dough into the bottom of the pie pan.
Fill the pie with the filling of your choice.
Roll the second crust and place over the filling.
Press the edges together and flute by pinching the dough together with 2 fingers.
Cover the edges of the crust with strips of aluminum foil to prevent the crust from getting too brown.
Remove the foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking.
For a prebaked bottom crust, preheat the oven to 350F.
Prick the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Cool before filling.

Finely chop or possibly coarsely grind onions and peppers.
2.
Peel, if you like, and chop fresh tomatoes or possibly canned, whole, peeled tomatoes into small pcs.
3.
Add in onions, peppers, and other ingredients to minced tomatoes.
Heat to simmering; simmer 10 min.
4.
Pack into clean, warm pint or possibly half-pint jars.
Seal.
5.
Follow processing directions; process 15 min in simmering warm water bath.
Fresh peppers are usually hotter than pickles, canned, or possibly glass-packed peppers.
Any one can be used, but fresh peppers give better flavor.
The hotness of the salsa depends on the kind and amount of peppers used.
For a very mild salsa, use fewer peppers.



Heat grill to medium-high heat.
Blend dressing, basil and cheese in blender until smooth.
Toss 1/4 cup pesto with combined chicken and tomatoes.

Grill 5 min.
on each side or until chicken is done.



Note: I always make bread dough with my standing mixer using a dough hook.
Although artisan bread can easily be made by mixing it in a bowl with a large spoon.
In the mixer's bowl, whisk together the water, milk, yeast, salt, yogurt and honey.
Add the flours, about 1/3 at a time, while mixing on low to medium speed.
When all of the flour has been added and combined, turn the mixer to medium and let it knead the dough for a minute or two.
Transfer to a larger bowl that has been coated lightly with olive oil to prevent sticking.
Cover the container loosely with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, leaving some way for air to escape.
Allow it to rest at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until the dough rises and collapses.
The dough can be used immediately after its initial rise, though it's much easier to handle when cold.
Refrigerate until ready to use.
It will last for 7 days, when refrigerated.
At this point it can also be frozen.
I'll typically freeze the dough in 1/4 pound portions and thaw in the refrigerator overnight before the day I'd like to use it.
Note: This batch of dough makes enough for sixteen 1/4 pound portions.
Each 1/4 pound portion will make 2 pieces of naan, 1 pizza crust, or 1 flatbread.
On baking day -- punch down a 1/4 pound portion of dough and divide into two equal balls.
Using a rolling-pin, roll each piece of dough into an oval shape.
The dough should be about 6-8 inches long and about 1/4-inch thick, but no thinner.
Repeat this method with the rest of the dough, or as much as you'd like to make.
Warm a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (you want a hot pan).
Brush both sides of the naan with olive oil or clarified butter.
Place the Naan on the hot skillet, cover and bake for 1 minute, until you see bubbles starting to form.
Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side until large toasted spots appear on the underside.
Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish.
Repeat with the rest of the naan.

If you're making the shortbread from scratch then start here:.
Beat the butter with a wooden spoon to soften it.
Beat in the sugar, followed by the flour (sifted to avoid awkward lumps).
Work the ingredients, first with the spoon, then with your hands, until you have a soft dough that completely stays together without leaving bits in the bowl.
Divide the dough into two equal sized pieces.
Transfer the dough to a flat surface and roll out lightly until it 5mm to a centimetre thick.
Place each half of the dough into a separate 9 inch square tin.
Prick the shortbread all over with a fork.
Cook the shortbread in a very low oven (300F, 150C, GM2) for 50 minutes.
The shortbread will almost certainly not go hard while still in the oven.
It needs to cool before it firms up.
If you have bought 400g of shortbread:.
Place the shortbread in a sandwich bag and bash with a rolling pin until you have a bag of biscuit crumbs.
Melt 50g of butter, add the shortbread crumbs and mix inches.
Press into the bottom of the two 9 inch square tins and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
To make the caramel:.
Place the butter and sugar into a pan over a medium heat and stir until butter is melted and sugar dissolved.
Add the can of sweetened condensed milk.
Increase the heat and stir vigorously until the mixture just begins to boil.
Important: It will look like there is a massive excess of melted butter floating on the top.
If you remove this the mixture WILL NOT SET so LEAVE IT THERE!
Just as the mixture begins to boil (i.e.
you see the first big bubbles break the surface) remove from the heat and continue to stir vigorously for 2 minutes.
Pour the caramel over the chilled shortbread, and leave to set for 20 minutes.
To finish:.
Melt 400g of milk chocolate in a glass bowl over boiling water.
(For the best result, break the chocolate into pieces no smaller than 1 inch square, heat water until it is at a rolling boil, add chocolate, and then reduce to a simmer with only a few large bubbles and DO NOT TOUCH until most of the chocolate has melted).
Pour over the shortbread.
Now refrigerate for several hours until set.
Score each tin into 24 pieces.



PINEAPPLE BROTH: Drain all juice from canned pineapple (no actual pineapple yet) into small bowl.
Add broth until there is enough liquid to fill one cup combined.
TERIYAKI SAUCE: After making pineapple/juice broth mixture, combine first 6 ingredients in small sauce pan.
In separate cup, combine cornstarch and water (COLD) and mix thoroughly.
Set cornstarch and water mixture aside.
Heat ingredients in sauce pan over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the bottom from burning.
Just prior to boiling point, slowly add the corstarch and water while stirring CONSTANTLY.

Preheat oven to 375F.
Combine dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in another.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet in 1/2 cup increments and blend with a hand mixer.
Pull off a large chunk of dough, sprinkle with a little flour, and roll it out to 1/8-inch-thick on top of either a silicone baking mat (i.e.
Silpat) or parchment paper.
You're going to roll it so thinly that you won't be able to move it from the surface you've rolled it on, so one of these two items is really necessary.
Score the rolled out dough with a large chef's knife to make 1-inch squares.
You'll be able to more easily snap the cooked treats apart later.
With a toothpick, poke a hole in the center of each square.
This will help prevent the treats from puffing up too much.
Transfer the silicone baking mat or parchment paper with the treats to a baking sheet for stability and bake for 20 minutes or until crispy.
While you dont want them burnt, you also don't want soft spots.
Some of the treats in the center of the rolled out dough might need an extra few minutes.
Alternately, you can let them dry further in the oven for an hour or so after you turn it off.
Completely dried treats store better/longer!
Cool treats completely, break apart, and store in an airtight container.
Give no more than 1-2 treats daily and adore your appreciative bunny!

Mix until yeast is dissolved.
Add a few cups of flour and begin mixing.
If preparing bread by hand, the first few cups of flour can be mixed in the bowl with a spool.
However, you will need to remove dough from the bowl and begin mixing by hand once it becomes thicker.
Continue adding flour until the dough becomes smooth and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl.
You'll need less flour for white bread than you will for whole wheat flour--or you can use any combination of both.
My mom sold a lot of half and half bread.
If kneading by hand, the dough should stick to your hands slightly.

I used a starter mixture made from 50ml natural yeast liquid (this time I used raisins) and 50g bread flour.
Add the water, starter mix, sugar, domestic flour, and salt to the bread maker in order, and start it on the dough making course!
Let it sit as-is after the dough course has finished (since it takes time for the homemade natural yeast to ferment).

Refresh a portion of your sourdough starter using equal parts rye flour and water.
This will give you a rye starter that you can maintain like your other starter if you wish.
This dough is very sticky and cement-like.
I find that frequently dipping spoons, scrapers and your fingers into water helps reduce the mess that this dough loves to make.

Using a wetted bench scraper and wet hands, just fold and mix as well as you can for a few minutes.
Divide the dough in half and form two balls of dough.
Spray two 8" x 4" bread pans (standard loaf pans) with oil and line with parchment paper.
I spray the parchment paper as well.
Preheat your oven to 375F.
Press the dough into the pans, smoothing with wet hands.
Seeds or white flour can be added to the surface if desired.
Cover with oiled plastic wrap.
and let rise in a 70F to 80F area until the loaves rise about 30% (about 2- 3 hours).
Bake for 45 minutes or longer until the internal temperature is 200F I rotate the loaves in the oven after 20 minutes of baking.
Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on a rack thoroughly before slicing.
The taste improves with time and the bread will last for several days or more at room temperature.
Slice thinly - enjoy.



Slice the plums in half and remove the pits.
Cut each plum into 8 pieces and put them in a medium, nonreactive saucepan with the water.
Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until tender.
Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar until dissolved.
Let cool to room temperature.
Once the mixture is cool, puree it in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Freeze according to the instructions for freezing granita on page 145.



Mix yeast and 1/4 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl.
Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
The yeast will dissolve and become foamy.
Put the flour, salt, sugar, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder into the bowl of a food processor.
Press the pulse button a few times to mix everything together.
Mix the dissolved yeast mixture with 1 cup lukewarm water.
Turn the food processor on.
Pour the water and yeast into the food processor through the hole in the top.
Let the machine run until the dough makes a ball.
If the dough is too sticky to make a ball, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor and knead on a floured countertop until the dough is very smooth.
Pour one tablespoon of olive oil into a medium bowl and swirl it around until the bowl is coated.
Place dough ball into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Place in a warm, draft-free place.
The dough should rise (grow) until it is twice as big as when you put it in the bowl.
This should take about 1 hour.
Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl.
Using your fist, press all the air out of the dough.
The dough is now ready to roll out and prepare according to the pizza recipe directions.
(NOTE: You can wrap your dough in plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours before making pizza.



In a food processor add the 3 cups of spelt flour and salt.
Process for a minute to incorporate the flour and salt.
Combine the non-dairy milk and light oil in a cup and mix well.
I use a whisk to do this.
Then feed the milk-oil mixture through the feeding tube in the food processor and into the flour mixture.
The dough should be in large crumbles.
At this point, stop the machine and feel the dough.
It shouldn't be sticky or dry, but a little oily and hold together well.
Try not to handle the dough too much as it tends to toughen the dough.
Once you have the right consistency remove the dough crumbles onto a prepared surface to roll out your dough.
I use a large plastic sheet, but waxed paper can also be used.
I try to avoid using a floured surface as it will make the dough dry.
I have found that with this dough that it isn't necessary.
Shape the dough into a disc and cut it in half.
Reshape the first piece of dough into a disc and roll it out.
I wrap the dough around my rolling pin then place it onto the pie pan and unroll.
Once I have the dough in place I position it carefully but do not stretch it, it will shrink.
I prick the sides and bottom of the bottom crust.
Fill the pie with the desired ingredients and roll out the second disc of dough and put it on top.
Flute the edges with a fork and then trim the pie crust edges.
Brush the pie with some of the non-dairy milk and then make slits in the top crust to let out the steam.
Bake according to the type of pie you are making.
Enjoy!

Use enough buttermilk to make the dough really sticky but still enough to knead and roll out.
Mix the ingredients together (add the buttermilk a little at a time).
Turn out the dough on a floured board and knead in more self rising flour (but try not to handle the dough too much!
).
Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch and then fold the dough over to double it and press on it lightly.
This fold in the dough will make the biscuits pull apart easily after they are cooked.
Cut out biscuits about 2 1/2 inches in diameter using a glass dipped in flour.
Re-roll the dough as needed.
Place the biscuits in a baking pan up close against each other - this will make them rise higher.
Some people put a little bit of vegetable oil in one end of the pan and run the tops of the biscuits through the oil then place them in the other end of the pan.
This makes them get crustier and browner on top.
Bake the biscuits at 450F (230C) until they are lightly browned (about 15 minutes).
Serve with butter, jelly, honey, or filled with bacon, sausage, etc.
1 cup of flour makes about 4 or 5 biscuits, but you can increase the recipe easily, just always use one spoon of shortening the size of a small egg for each cup of flour.

Heat the water until it reaches 206 on an instant-read thermometer; alternatively, bring the water to a boil, then let stand for 1 minute.
Pour some of the hot water into the carafe, thoroughly soaking the filter.
Discard the rinsing water (the wet filter will remain in place as you pour out the water).
Pour the ground coffee into the filter.
Place the Chemex on a kitchen scale and set the scale to zero.
Pour 80 grams of the hot water all over the coffee grounds, thoroughly saturating them.
Let stand until the coffee stops bubbling, about 1 minute.
Pour 120 grams of the hot water onto the coffee in a thin, steady, spiral stream, working from the center of the filter to the edge, then back to the center again.
Working in roughly 100-gram increments, pour the remaining 400 grams of hot water in a small circular motion in the center of the filter; maintain a water level that is just high enough that the coffee is never exposed to air.
Allow all of the coffee to drain into the carafe and serve.

To make pie, make crust and bake.
Into prepared crust, put thawed filling and bake till warmed through.
Crumb topping can be added before baking filling if you want (I use sugar, cinnamon, margarine and minced pecans.)
I found which the thickener
(the flour, water, etc.
mix which is cooked first) made a lot more than could be used up by 24 c of apples.
I think I got a total of 8-10 large containers (I use empty 32 ounce yogurt containers).
One of these containers was just sufficient for a 9 in pie.
I also used (do not tell anybody) prepared pie shells just fine with this filling.
I also used a large nonstick pot to cook this in and had very little problem with sticking at medium to medium high temperature.

(Thicken the liquid a bit at a time.)
When the liquid has thickened quite a bit, add water little by little to dissolve the flour.
The key is to add the water a little at a time!
Also, don't ever break down the walls of the well!
Otherwise your work surface will become flooded with water...
Always pour the water onto the flour.
When all the water has been added, use your pastry scraper in a cutting motion to mix the water in.
(Don't knead the mixture; you don't want to develop the gluten in the flour.)
When the water is mixed in, gather up the dough into a ball with the seams inside, and pull the surface a bit tight.
The dough doesn't have to be smooth at this stage!
As you let the dough rest in the refrigerator and fold in the butter, it will become silky smooth.
Make a deep cross cut into the dough, wrap up in plastic and rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour.
While the detrempe is resting, prepare the butter that will be folded into it.
Sandwich the butter between sheets of plastic film (make sure the plastic sheets are big enough to accommodate the butter when it's flattened) and beat down on it with a rolling pin to flatten it out.
The butter is cold but it will become soft and silky.
Cut and form the butter with a pastry scraper or other tool to neaten it up.
It should become a neat square that's about the same size as the cutting edge of the scraper.
Start folding the butter (beurrage) into the rested detrempe.
Press out the detrempe that had the deep cross cut in it away from you as if you were pushing it.
(It's hard to describe...) Turn the dough to press it out on all 4 sides.
Here's how it should look at this point.
After all 4 sides are pressed out, it should look like this.
The middle should be a bit thicker than the rest.
Put the squared off silky butter on the thick part of the dough.
(Check the consistency of the butter.
It should be just soft enough that if you press on it with your finger, it leaves a mark.
If it's too hard it's difficult to roll out.
Butter hardens right away when you put it in the refrigerator, so be careful!)
Bring the opposing corners of the dough to the middle and fold.
Do the same with the two other opposing corners.
The key is to wrap the dough tightly around the butter so that there are no air pockets in between the layers.
Roll out with a rolling pin.
To start, push the rolling pin in small movements, then roll it back and forth.
Dust with flour frequently but sparingly.
(It's a bit complicated I know...) Flip the dough over as you roll it frequently too.
(The dough does stick easily to the work surface...) When the dough has thinned out, roll it around the rolling pin and flip over.
Roll until it's as long as the rolling pin.
Start folding!
Brush off any excess flour, and fold in about 1/4 of the dough.
Bring the bottom part of the dough on top.
Tightly seal the seams closed using the rolling pin.
The key is to bring the folds all the way up to the corners.
If the corners are rounded, pull on them with your hands to make them square like a puzzle.
This way the dough will have a nice neat finish, and will be easier to handle too.
Cut the dough in half.
(If you don't do that and fold the dough in the middle, the first fold will stick out to the size, and the dough will split there.)
Wrap tightly in plastic, and rest in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
Turn the dough 90 degrees from the previous step (so that the fold is on the side), and repeat steps 14 to 18 three more times.
If you roll out the width (in the direction it was rolled before) first, it's easier to handle.
The more you roll out the dough, the silkier it will get.
Then you're done!

NOTE: SOME FIVE-SPICE RECIPES WILL HAVE YOU TOAST THE WHOLE FENNEL AND STAR ANISE FIRST.
YOU MAY DO THIS, BUT I GENERALLY PREFER NOT TO FOR A CLEAN, FRESH FLAVOR.
HOWEVER, IF USING THE SPICE SPECIFICALLY FOR BARBECUED MEATS OR PHO SOUP, I RECOMMEND LIGHTLY TOASTING THEM FIRST IN A DRY SKILLET OVER MEDIUM HEAT FOR A SMOKY FLAVOR BEFORE THE FINAL GRINDING.
YOU MAY SUBSTITUTE THE SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN WITH WHITE PEPPER, WHICH IS A POPULAR BLEND FOR USE IN CHINESE COOKERY.
KEEP IN MIND -- "A LITTLE BIT OF FIVE SPICE POWDER GOES A LONG WAY".
WHEN SEASONING FOODS, START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT, THEN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.
MEASURE all ingredients into a clean spice mill or coffee grinder, whether whole or ground, using pre-ground cinnamon as the only exception: 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon fennel, 1 tablespoon star anise, 1 tablespoon Szechuan peppercorn.
GRIND mixture in a clean spice mill or coffee grinder in 15-30 second increments, until mixture is finely powderized.
Store in an airtight container.
Use measure-for-measure in any recipe calling for Chinese Five Spice powder.

TO MAKE GELATO: Freeze according to the instructions with your ice cream maker.
The mixture is thick to begin with and may take less time than average in the ice cream maker.
Makes one scant quart ice cream.
TO MAKE FUDGE POPS: Divide the chilled gelato base between the ice pop molds and place in the freezer overnight to set.
These will have a slightly icy texture.
(If you have an ice cream maker and would like a finer-textured fudge pop, freeze the gelato base according to the instructions with your ice cream maker and divide the mixture evenly between ice pop molds.
Place in the freezer overnight to set.
).
TO MAKE GRANITA: Pour the chilled gelato base into a large, shallow baking dish (the shallower the dish, the faster the mixture will freeze) and place in the freezer.
In about an hour, the liquid will begin to freeze along the sides of the pan.
Using a fork, scrape the ice towards the center of the pan.

Start making your dough around 4 to 6 hours before you want to eat.
Most of that time will be unattended.
Heat water in microwave or saucepan.
It should be around 110 degrees.
You can test the water by dipping the underside of your wrist in it.
It should feel about the right temperature for baby bath water.
Water hot enough to burn a baby is also hot enough to kill yeast!
Stir water, sugar, and yeast together until yeast dissolves.
Add the olive oil and the salt.
Stir in the flour.
It will seem like you have way too much flour.
When you can't stir any more flour in, turn the entire contents of your bowl out onto a clean surface and knead in the rest of the flour.
Grease a large bowl (about double the size of your dough).
Put the dough in the bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until double in size (about 1 1/2 to two hours depending on temperature.)
Should be more than 80 degrees (will still rise if cooler but will take much much longer) but never over 120 degrees (which is hot enough to kill yeast.)
Punch down and let rise again, probably another 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
About 1 hour before you want to eat, split dough into 3 pieces and roll into balls.
If you have a pizza stone, now is the time to put it in the oven to heat it up.
If you don't, just preheat the oven to 425 and get your pan out.
Wrap the balls in saran wrap to keep the dough from drying out (you may be tempted to skip this step, but it is much easier to roll out soft dough!
).
Now's the time to cut up some toppings.
Set your mooching friends and family, if you have them, to work!
On a clean, dry, floured surface, roll out the first ball into a round roughly the size of your pizza pan or stone.
Transfer the dough round to the stone or pan, and brush the crust with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic salt or garlic powder.
Put on your toppings.
I do pizza sauce, then a bit of mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers, pepperoni, ham, or whatever is currently in the fridge.
Then I top with a lot of cheese.
Bake at 425 for 15 minutes.
Enjoy!
:-D.

Beat in 2 cups of the flour, sugar, butter, and salt.
Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough starts pulling away from the sides of the bowl.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place until the dough doubles in bulk, about 2 hours.
Punch down the dough and turn it onto a floured surface.
Roll dough to about 1/2-inch thick and use a drinking glass to cut circles and a smaller round cutter or bottle cap to cut out the holes.
Obviously, if you dont have a doughnut cutter yet!
Cover doughnuts (and holes) and let rise until puffy looking, for about 30 minutes.
Heat an inch or two of oil in a large heavy pot.
Set a cooling rack over a baking sheet and put them near the pot.
Add 3 or 4 doughnuts (or 8 to 10 doughnut holes) to the oil.
They should sizzle immediately as you add them to the oil.

COOKING DIRECTIONS:.
I pre-measure out all my ingredients first, so I don't have to fumble around (I'm prone to spilling things!)
during the assembly & cooking phases.
Line the pan with aluminum foil.
Melt butter over medium to high heat, stirring occasionally so it doesn't scorch on the bottom.
The butter, when cooked correctly, should smell toasty and have a golden brown, nutty color.
Add sugar, milk & corn syrup to the butter.
Stir until sugar is dissolved.
Using the candy thermometer, cook to 235 degrees (soft ball).
Cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes.
Scrape the candy into the electric mixer & beat the candy until it becomes thick, creamy & isn't shiny.
If you mix by hand or hand-held mixer, be prepared for it to take longer.
WARNING: If you over-beat it, the texture becomes grainy.
Add the vanilla.
Add the nuts (if using).
Scrape the fudge into the lined pan & smooth the top evenly.
Let the fudge set firm, either at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
When the fudge is set, cut it into small 1 inch squares.
Store the fudge in airtight container at room temperature for a week or in the refrigerator for up to a month.

Coat an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with butter.
Cut a piece of parchment paperit should be a little less than 8 inches wide and long enough so that it rides over two sides of the dish when pressed into it.
Press the parchment paper flat into the baking dish, creasing the paper at the corners.
Coat the parchment-lined pan with more butter and place it on a wire rack.
Place the cream in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the sugar, corn syrup, and brown sugar and return to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugars have dissolved, about 3 minutes.
Reduce the heat to medium and keep the mixture at a gently rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 255 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 to 25 minutes.
(It will reach 225 degrees F very quickly but then very slowly rise toward 255 degrees F.)
Remove the pan from heat, add the butter, vanilla, and 2 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, and stir until the butter has melted and the mixture is combined.
Pour into the prepared dish and let cool until the surface of the caramel is set and the dish is only slightly warm, about 1 hour.
Place the dish in the freezer until the caramel is just firm, about 15 to 20 minutes (do not let it freeze for too long).
Run a knife along the edges of the caramel.
Using the exposed edges of parchment paper, pull the caramel slab from the pan, flip it over onto a work surface, and remove the parchment.
Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon fleur de sel and press gently so that the salt adheres to the caramel.
Cut into 3/4-inch squares.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Transfer all of the caramels to the baking sheet (making sure they dont touch) and place in the refrigerator to harden again.
Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, turn off the heat.
Place 18 ounces of the chocolate in a dry, heatproof bowl.
Set the bowl over the saucepan and, using a rubber spatula, stir until the chocolate has completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F.)
Remove the bowl from the saucepan.
Add the remaining 6 ounces chocolate and stir until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. (To speed this step up, you can place the bowl of chocolate over a bowl of ice waterbut only once all of the chocolate has melted.)
Once cooled, return the bowl of chocolate to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat.
Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range while dipping the caramels or it will not set properly.)
Keep the saucepan of water over low heat and, when needed, set the bowl of chocolate over it to reheat.
To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on a piece of parchment paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set.
If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered.
(If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.)
Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove the caramels from the refrigerator.
Drop a caramel into the chocolate and, using a dinner fork, turn it to coat.
Lift it out of the chocolate and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl.
Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate.
Place the coated caramel on the empty baking sheet.
Repeat with the remaining caramels, using the first baking sheet when the second sheet is full and making sure the caramels do not touch.
Let sit until the chocolate sets.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Place 5 cups of all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup of potato flakes in a large bowl.
Retain 1 cup flour for later use.
Add 1/2 cup of water to the dry ingredients and mix by hand.
Continue to add water by the tablespoon until the flour is incorporated - but not sticky.
If the dough mixture becomes too sticky - add flour until the dough is dry to the touch.
Lightly flour the working surface.
Turn the dough mixture onto the floured working surface and continue to knead the dough until it is smooth.
Cover the dough with a clean towel and let rest for approximately 15 minutes.
Once the dough has rested for approximately 15 minutes, divide the dough into 4 pieces.
Re-flour each piece thoroughly.
Using a rolling pin, flatten each piece of dough until it is approximately 1/8-inch thick.
Using a pizza cutter - cut each piece of dough into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide and each strip into "little nuggets" approximately 3/4-inch wide.
Using the tip of a dinner fork slightly tilted on an angle, press each "nugget" into the fork tip and roll downward.
This will give you a little round piece of dough with ridges.
Place the finished gnocchi on a floured pan until the process has been completed with all of the remaining dough.
Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil - add the finished gnocchi carefully to the boiling water and stir completely to avoid sticking.
Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook the gnocchi for approximately 8 minutes or until the desired tenderness is attained.
Drain the gnocchi thoroughly using a colander and serve immediately with your favorite sauce.

First, rinse your hair with the vinegar, dont wash it out, leave it in until it dries.
The vinegar dissolves the glue which sticks the eggs to your hair follicles.
When the vinegar has dried, pour coconut oil into your hair, making sure you get complete coverage.
Cover your hair with a shower cap or hair wrap & leave it in for the whole day, as it will take a few hours for the coconut oil to smother & kill the lice.
Comb your hair to get as many of the eggs & lice out as possible and then shampoo as normal.
You only have to do this once, it really works & no chemicals!
Note from, K8recipe -- I noticed this and thought I should share some information that, after exhaustive research, helped me.
My foster daughter, now my own through adoption, .
.
.
ALWAYS came home infested.
After much research, I discovered Tea Tree Oil.
That was 6 years ago.
.
.
.
but she also is always immune to any outbreaks at school as well.
The tea tree oil (TTO) kills the Louse Central Nervous System (CNS) so they cannot move around and reproduce.
Of course, they also die because they cannot feed.
Tea tree oil also acts as a repellent because Lice cannot stand it.
Therefore, if your child has lice: Apply freely to the scalp and around ears and neck, wherever lice are prominant.
Soak the hair in TTO and cover with a cap and sleep on it.
Put a towel down on the pillowcase or around their area bcz the oil will stain.
As a preventative, we add just a few drops to her shampoo to repel and discourage those nasty little blood suckers.
I swear by this and I feel the need to share anytime I can.
I struggled SO much, was overcome with frustration and at my wits and when I discovered this.
TTO can be found in WALMART vitamin/mineral aisle or at any health food store.
Please pass this on as I'm sure you know someone who could use this info.
Kate.

Its just like when you cook pasta.
The potatoes need this.
Skim off any foam that may rise to the top.
Once the water boils (about 10 minutes into the cooking process), turn the heat down to get a simmer, which is basically an almost boil.
Allow the potatoes to cook until a knife poked through them slides right through with no resistance at all.
This should take another 20 minutes or so.
Dont worry about overcooking them.
The secret is to never undercook your potatoes.
Once theyre ready, drain the water out.
Put the pot back on med-low and use a potato masher to completely mash the potatoes.

Shape the halves into balls and leave to rest under a damp cloth for 15 minutes.
Lightly punch out the gas again, and with a rolling pin, roll the dough out into an oblong, elliptical shape.
Fold the dough in half over the vertical axis and roll up.
Make sure the seam is sealed up tightly.
Place the rolls seam side down inside a lightly oiled loaf tin.
Leave to prove for a second time at 40C until the dough takes up half of the tin (this should take around 90 minutes).
This is what it should look like after the second proving.
Bake for 20-25 minutes in an oven preheated to 200C.
If it looks like the top is going to burn, cover it with aluminium foil.
When baked, leave the loaf in the tin and drop it from around 30 cm onto your counter or working surface.
Remove the bread from the tin as early as possible.
My Proving Method Fill a frying pan with 42C warm water and place the loaf tin inside If the water cools down, simply heat it back up.
This bread is so soft when just out of the oven.
If it cools, you can re-heat it in the microwave.

Cover with a tea towel and allow to rest 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, shape the dough into a ball.
Coat hands with flour, if needed, to prevent sticking.
Sprinkle the tea towel with half of the cornmeal and lay the dough on top of it, with the seam side down.
Sprinkle the top of the dough with the other half of the cornmeal and cover with the towel.
Allow to rise for another 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.
Oven baking: While the dough is rising the second time, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 4 to 5-quart Dutch oven in the oven while it preheats.
Once the dough is ready, carefully transfer it to the pre-heated Dutch oven.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove the lid and bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, another 15 minutes.
Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
Outdoor coals: Heat charcoal in a chimney starter until ash covers all of the coals.
Place 20 to 24 coals on a Dutch oven table.
Place a cooling rack (or other wire rack that is at least 2-inches high) directly over the coals.
Set a 5-quart Dutch oven on top of this rack and allow to preheat during the last 30 minutes of the second rise.
Carefully transfer the dough to the Dutch oven and cover with the lid.
Place 20 coals on top.
Bake until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 to 212 degrees F, about 45 minutes.

Trim any excess external fat from the meat.
Submerge the pork in the brine in a large bowl or small crock; make sure the meat stays under the surface during curing by using a heavy plate to weight it down.
Refrigerate the pork in the cure.
The chops should take 4-6 hours in the brine; the tenderloin, 6-8 hours; and the loin, 1-2 days.
(Bone-in pork can take a day longer in the brine because of the bone, which gives it a larger diameter.)
If marinating for a day or longer, stir the brine daily and turn the pork occasionally.
To test flavor of brined pork, cut a small piece off the meat, pat it dry and pan-fry it.
If the meat is sufficiently flavorful, remove it from the brine, let it come to room temperature and grill.
If not, leave it in the brine and test again later.
I usually do a 4-6 lb pork loin and marinate 24 hours.
I have cooked in oven, indirect heat on grill and rotisserie.
They have all turned out fabulous!
This makes a VERY moist piece of meat when brined this way.

Brining chicken and turkey, I have been converted to their way of thinking.
It does make the meat moister and tastier.
The standard solution they recommend, and I've been using, for a 6 - 8 lb.
turkey breast or possibly a chicken is:Soak for 5 hrs.
I would appreciate your thoughts on how to apply this "formula" to an 18-21 pound whole turkey.
I believe which the solution would remain the same but I'm not sure how to adjust the soaking solution.
Would 5 hrs still allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the entire turkey How long might be entire turkey and care to share it with me

Place the balls on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Once filled, put the baking sheet in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.
While the peanut butter balls are in the freezer, fill a small pot with 1 of water.
Turn the heat on low and bring the water to a slow simmer.
Place the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl that is slightly larger than the pot you are going to use.
Set the bowl over the pot (make sure the bottom of the bowl doesnt touch the water) and allow the chocolate to slowly melt, stirring until smooth.
Do not increase the heat.
Once the chocolate is melted, remove the bowl and pot from the heat.
Drop one peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate and use a spoon or fork to turn it and completely cover the peanut butter ball in chocolate.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water with the sugar.
Add the salt, butter, and 3 cups of the flour.
Mix until smooth.
Add in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough, adding more flour if needed.
Push your fingers into the dough; the dough should feel like its going to stick to your fingers as you pull them away, but doesnt.
Thats how you know the consistency is just right.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 to 20 minutes.
Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down.
Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup, measure out the dough for 12 rolls.
Shape each into a ball.
You may have a little bit of dough left over, so make whatever you want with that.
Place the rolls into a greased 9x13 pan.
Cover and let rise until they are at least double in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
You can let them rise longer to get even larger rolls, but you need to watch them carefully so they dont over-rise and then deflate when they bake.
I always let them rise to their maximum capacity.
Also, note if you are using regular yeast or rapid rise yeast; this will change the rising times, as will the temperature in your house.
Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
After I take them out of the oven, I always spread butter over the tops of the rolls.
Note: the dough can also be done in a bread machine on the dough cycle if you have that, but just be sure to still test the dough midway through the kneading cycle to make sure the consistency is correct.
After the dough is done rising, proceed with the recipe as directed.

Add remaining ingredients and mix until the dough holds together.
If its hot or warm in the kitchen or outside, chill the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325F Divide the dough into four pieces and roll each into a ball.
Place a piece of parchment paper on a flat surface, flattening the balls of dough onto the parchment.
Place another piece of parchment paper on top and then roll the dough to about 10&#8243; in diameter and about 1/8&#8243; thick.
Cut circles about 1 1/4&#8243; across from the dough with a cookie cutter and refrigerate if the excess dough doesnt lift away easily enough.
Transfer the parchment onto the cookie sheet.
Bake 12 minutes, and repeat with remaining dough, using scraps at the end until all the dough is used up.

Using a fork, stir and draw flour from bottom of bowl to the top, distributing moisture evenly into flour.
Press chunks down to bottom of bowl with fork.
Add more water by the tablespoon, until dough is moist enough to hold together when pressed together.
To test the dough for proper moistness by squeezing a marble-sized ball of dough in your hand.
If it holds together firmly, do not add any additional water.
If the dough crumbles, add more water by the tablespoonful, until dough is moist enough to form a smooth ball when pressed together.
Shape the dough into a ball.
For ease in rolling, wrap dough in plastic wrap.
Chill for 30 minutes or up to 2 days.

Wash the chestnuts, pour in enough water to cover them and cook them for 8-12 minutes in a pressure cooker.
When the pressure has dropped, drain them in a sieve and spoon out the insides.
Place all the ingredients except for the rum in a saucepan and mash the chestnuts as they simmer (simmer well until the water has evaporated).
When it has cooled down, put the mixture in a food processor, and add the rum for the aroma and blend.
Pour it into a sterilized container and it's done.
Note: It has a lot of water but it is low in sugar, so it won't keep for very long.
Refrigerate the amount you wish to use and freeze the rest.

When the dough is consistent begin rolling dough balls about the size of a ping pong ball.
Using a tortilla press that is lined in a thick plastic, press out the dough.
You use the plastic (it can be a ziploc bag that has been cut) so that the dough does not stick to the tortilla press.
Meanwhile have a deep pot filled with cooking oil approximately 2 inches high and heated to 250 degrees.
Drop the flat tortilla in the hot oil and using a metal spatula repeatedly douse with the oil.
You will see that it will begin to puff up.
Flip it over and using the spatula make an indention in the middle of the tortilla to forma taco shape.
Remove from oil and allow to drain.
Fill with ground meat, shredded chicken, guacamole, bean and cheese or your favorite filling.

Mix flour, milk and mayo together, reserving the second measure of flour for the board.
Add the second measure of flour to the board and coat your hands.
Turn out the dough onto the floured board or counter top.
Sprinkle some extra flour on top of the dough.
Just enough to make the dough easier for you to work with and not so sticky.
You want to get it just to the not too sticky point but not add so much flour that they become dense.
It is hard to say how much as this varies with the climate and humidity.
Knead lightly just until the dough is smooth-about 6 times.
The less you handle it, the better the biscuits!
Pat into a square shape and make long cuts with a very sharp knife from top to bottom and then side to side--like a tic tac toe board and you will havce 9 biscuits.
Add one extra line to make 12 squares.
I usually cut to make 12, but make them as large or small as you like.
Place on lightly greased or sprayed cookie sheet just a tiny bit apart- about 1/2 inch- and bake at 450F for 15 to 20 minutes or until browned on top.

Note: Don't have any self-rising flour?
Add 1 tsp salt and 1 T baking powder to the flour.



Combine ingredients in a small bowl and mix thoroughly.



In a large bowl, combine the oats, oat flour and crisp rice cereal.
Set aside.
In a small saucepan, combine the peanut butter, honey and kosher salt.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until well mixed and the peanut butter is warmed through and melted.
Remove from the heat, add the vanilla-nut extract (or vanilla extract) and mix until well combined.
Pour the peanut butter mixture over the oat/cereal mixture and stir until well combined.
Its sticky and doesnt appear to want to mix in, but keep stirring and it will.
I start the process with a wooden spoon and once the peanut butter mixture is coating the cereal, I use my hands to continue mixing and breaking apart the larger pieces of cereal.
Add the mix-ins of your choice.
If youre using chocolate, let the cereal mixture cool before adding so the chocolate wont melt.
Stir again to mix well.
Once the granola is completely cooled, store in an airtight container.
Notes: 1.
If you dont have oat flour on hand, you can make it by grinding oats in a blender or food processor.
I take a rounded 1/2 cup of oats and use my Magic Bullet to pulse the oats until theyre a smooth, flour-like consistency.
Grind the oats, then measure them to equal 1/2 cup.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, stirring until melted and smooth and cool slightly.
Stir in the corn syrup (chocolate will stiffen almost immediately) until completely combined.
Transfer chocolate to a plastic freezer bag and refrigerate until firm (about two hours).
When the paste is firm, remove from the refrigerator, and knead it until it is soft enough to work with.
Tip: If it is too hard, cut off small pieces, and knead until pliable and grease the counter where you are working with oil or spray with Pam so the chocolate won't stick.
You can make the chocolate into whatever shape you want- it can be formed into a long rope/braid and wrapped around the base of the cake, or made into flowers, leaves, or any other decorations.
Another example is to pat the dough into a disk shape between plastic wrap or parchment and roll it out to desired thickness using a rolling pin, then cut into desired shapes or strips.
It will keep for months, wrapped properly (if it gets hard to work with knead in a little more corn syrup until it is pliable again).
Semi-Sweet Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 3 1/2- 4 TB light corn syrup.
White Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces (200 grams) white chocolate, chopped and 1 1/2- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup.
Milk Chocolate Modeling Paste- use 7 ounces Milk Chocolate and 2 1/2- 3 tablespoons light corn syrup.

Starting with the dough, begin by warming your milk for just a minute or two in the microwave, until it reaches between 105 and 115F No more, or else you'll kill the yeast.
Stir in the brown sugar, and sprinkle in the yeast and let sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes bubbly and alive.
Meanwhile, combine the first 4 cups of flour, spices, raisins, walnuts, carrots, ground flax, and salt in the bowl of your stand mixer.
Mix lightly just to distribute all of the ingredients evenly and coat the carrot shreds with flour.
Pour in the proofed yeast mixture, along with the oil and vanilla, and start mixing on a low speed, so as not to kick any flour out of the bowl.
Once incorporated, switch over to the dough hook, add in 1 more cup of flour, and allow the mixer to begin kneading the dough.
After about 5 minutes of mixing, assess the texture; You're looking for it to be tacky and elastic, not wet or sticky.
You may need to add up to another cup of flour, depending on the consistency.
Continue working the dough with the dough hook for 5 - 10 more minutes.
Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and kneed by hand briefly, for just 5 minutes or so, before placing it into a lightly oiled bowl.
Cover loosely with a cloth or piece of plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in volume.
Once risen, lightly grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans, and set aside.
Gently punch down the dough with your knuckles, cut it into two pieces, and on a well-floured surface, take one piece and roll it out into a rectangle.
Be sure to keep the two short sides no longer than 8 inches so that it will fit in the pan, but roll it out lengthwise as far as possible- The longer the dough, the more impressive your spiral will be in the finished loaf.
To make the cream cheese swirl, simply beat together the cream cheese, cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.
Take half of the mixture and smear it evenly over your rolled out dough, leaving about an inch of one short end clear.
You may want to spread a slightly thinner layer near the other edges, to prevent it from dripping out when you move the dough.
Starting with the short end that's fully covered, roll the dough up as tightly as possible without squeezing out the filling.
Pinch the end to the main body of the loaf to seal, and quickly but carefully transfer the whole thing to one of your waiting loaf pans, ends slightly folded under and seam-side down.
Repeat with the other piece of dough.
Let the breads rise for another hour or so, until about doubled or just peeking out above the edge of the pans, and then pop it them a 375 degree preheated oven, for about 26 - 36 minutes.
It should be golden brown on top, and when removed from the pan, it will sound hollow when tapped.
(Yes, you can cool it, tap it, and then toss it back in the oven if it doesn't sound right.)
Let cool completely before slicing.

** Bagel Success Hints
** When forming the bagels, set aside two 1/4" balls of dough.
When the bagels have doubled in size, drop the test dough into boiling water.
The dough should pop to the top right away.
When this happens, it is time to boil the bagels.
** A quick spray of non-stick vegetable coating on the top of the bagel may be substituted for the egg wash.
** To make bagel sticks, cut bagel before rising and lay out in a straight line.
Roll sticks in a combination of sesame and poppy seeds with a healthy pinch of garlic pwdr.
Let sticks rise, boil, and bake as described in the above directions.
** To make bagel chips, slice leftover bagels horizontally into thin slices.

1.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast and black pepper (you can do this with a regular old whisk instead of the whisk attachment).
Then whisk in the salt.
Attach the dough hook, turn the mixer on low speed (#2), add the water and mix for a minute, until all the flour is moistened (scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary).
Then knead the dough on medium speed (#4 on a KitchenAid) for 7 minutes.
2.
The dough should be sticky, but shouldnt stick to your finger if you touch it.
If its too wet, knead in extra flour, 1 tablespoon at a time until its right.
If its not sticky at all, but is rather dry, spray it with a little water and knead it in.
3.
Add the olives and mix on low speed until evenly incorporated (you might need to add in a little more flour now if the olives are very oily).
Dust the dough lightly with flour, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
4.
Shape the dough and let it rise: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and roll it around a little to lightly flour all surfaces of the dough.
Roll the dough between your hands and the counter into an 18 long rope, dusting with flour as necessary.
Shape the rope into a ring, overlapping the ends by 2 and pinching the seams together.
Transfer the ring to a baking sheet that youve lined with parchment paper.
The ring should be about 7 in diameter.
Oil a piece of plastic wrap and cover the dough with it, oiled side touching the dough.
Let rise at room temperature for an hour, until doubled in bulk (the ring will be about 9 in diameter).
5.
Once the loaf is shaped, set a rack in the lowest position in the oven and place a baking stone on it.
Set a baking sheet on the floor of the oven under the stone.
I use an old broiler pan for thisits to hold the ice cubes.
Turn the oven to 450 F and let it preheat for about an hour.
6.
When the loaf is doubled in size, brush it with half the melted butter and slide it, parchment paper included, onto the hot baking stone.
Toss the ice cubes in the baking sheet and immediately close the door (this produces steam and a great crust).
Bake for 20 minutes.
Turn the oven down to 400 F, slide the bread from the parchment directly onto the stone, rotating it a little as you do so.
Continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the bread is deep golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the bread should read about 211 F).
When its done, turn off the oven, open the oven door slightly, and leave the bread in the oven for 5 minutes.
7.
Remove the bread and transfer it to a wire rack.
Glaze with the remaining melted butter and cool completely.
Based on Prosciutto Ring in The Bread Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum.
As Rose instructs, you should tear this bread rather than cut it.
The texture is eternally satisfying.



Combine together in a large pot.
Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 45 minute stirring occassionally.
This recipe freezes well.



It seems foolish to say preheat the oven, when its frankly going to be on anyway, but if you were cooking this to go alongside say some cold, leftover turkey, when it would be just as good as first time around, then you need a hottish oven, say 400F, and the parsnips would need around 35 minutes in it.
But if youve got the oven on very hot because of the roast potatoes, then you are better off parboiling the parsnips so that they need less time actually in the oven; 15 minutes should be enough to turn them chewy and maple-bronzed.
So, peel the parsnips and halve them crosswise, then halve or quarter each piece lengthwise, so that you have a bundle of spindly shards.
Either blanch these fawn-colored twigs in salted boiling water for 3 or so minutes, or just put them straight into a roasting pan, pour over the oil, smoosh them about and then dribble over the maple syrup and roast until tender and stickily brown.
Be careful as you taste to test: the sugar content of the parsnips, more even than the syrup, make these blisteringly hot.



If using English or regular cucumbers, they need to be peeled, cut lengthwise, seeded and sliced into thin half moons.

NUSH-E JAN!
Saffron Syrup(Sharbat-e Zaferan) Add 1/2 teaspoon ground saffron threads diluted in 2 tablespoons hot water to the rose water.Barberry syrup(Sharbat-e zereshk) Add barberry juice to the rose water syrup above and cook for 5 minutes.
Barberry juice can be made from dried barberries by picking over and thoroughly washing 2 cups of barberries.
Combine with 4 cups of water and boil for 15 minutes over high heat.
Allow to cool and pass through 2 layers of cheesecloth into a bowl.Almond syrup(Sharbat-e badam) Replace rose water with almond milk.
To make almond milk puree 2 cups blanched almonds with 3 cups of boiling water in a food processor for 5 minutes, until creamy.
Strain the mixture through 2 layers of cheesecloth into a bowl.
Reserve the almond milk and discard the solids.Persian musk rose syrup(Sharbat-e nastaran) Replace rose water with musk rose water.Basil-seed syrup(Sharbat-e tokhm-e Sharbaty) Soak 1 cup of basil seeds in 2 cups of water for a few hours, then add soaking seeds to the syrup in Step 2.
An excellent syrup, this sharbat is especially associated with the mother of a newborn baby.Mint leaf syrup(Sharbat-e nana) Replace rose water with mint water.Orange blossom syrup(Sharbat-e gol-e bahar narenj) Replace rose water with orange blossom water.Licorice syrup(Sharbat-e lasmo) Replace rose water with licorice water.Palm syrup(Sharbat-e taruneh) Replace rose water with palm water.Willow syrup(Sharbat-e bidmeshk) Replace rose water with willow water.
NOTE:Rose water(suitable for cooking) and most of the distillates (called araqs in Persian) listed here are available in Persian stores (produced by Sadaf or Qortas).
Batmanglij recommends buying saffron in thread form rather than powder, which is often adulterated with turmeric.
Before they can be used in a recipe, the threads must be ground with a cube of sugar, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and then diluted in hot water.
"The saffron water can then be stored and used as needed," says Batmanglij.
"Never use the unground threads."
Dried barberries, which add a sour flavor to many Persian dishes, are available online at www.sadaf.com.
"Always buy red barberries," cautions Batmanglij.
"Black barberries are old."
Try experimenting with different distillates in this drink.
Musk rose water, made from white Mediterranean roses, gives the sharbat a different flavor than regular rose water, which is made from Persian Damask roses.
Willow water is flowery, while palm water has an earthy flavor.

Start off with separating the skin of the grapes from the inside (guts).
Its pretty easy to do with Concord grapes.
Just give them a squeeze and the insides pop right out.
Keep the skins in one bowl and the guts in another bowl.
Do this for all the grapes.
With a food processor, you are going to pulse the sugar and the skins together.
This is going to liquify the skins.
Its pretty cool!
Run your processor until its pretty smooth.
You will still have a small amount of skins still visible.
Once done, pour into a heavy-bottomed pot along with the insides of the grapes.
There will be seeds in this but itll be strained later so dont worry about them.
Also add your lemon juice.
Stir it together and turn it on high to bring to a boil.
Also at this time, start boiling some jars that you will be storing the jelly in.
Once the grapes come to a boil, turn to low and stir frequently.
You do not want the bottom to burn.
You will continue to cook at a simmer for 25 minutes.
At 25 minutes, check your consistency.
You want it to be pretty thick at this point and have boiled down to at least half.
If it hasnt gotten to this point, just continue to cook it.
Once you get it to the thickness you would like, you need to strain it into a bowl to remove the seeds and any of the skins that are left.
Take a spatula and push as much through the strainer as you can.
Place into jars and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
The 2 pounds of grapes made about 2.5 pints of jelly.

Mix ground chicken with chopped broccoli and cheese (I used an 8oz bag of the Kraft Crumbles).
Add Montreal Seasoning and form into burgers.
I bake them on a non-stick pan so no oil is needed and they still come out crispy (see photos).

The equation to find the elevated boiling point is as follows: M = k(w/eW), where M is the relationship between the molecular weight of the dissolved substance, k is the ebullioscopic constant, w is the weight of the solute (salt), and W is the weight of the solvent (water), and e is the elevation in boiling point.
Remember that atmospheric pressure also affects the boiling point of water.
For a rough measurement, a handful of salt in a pan of water raises the boiling point about a tenth of a degree.
Method:
1.
Take a large pot fill with 4 quarts water.
(Using ice brought to room temperature will triple the prep time.)
2.
Place pot carefully over burner on stove.
3.
Turn on the stove.
4.
Wait patiently.
(If patience grows thin, check to see if burner is lit).
5.
Do not watch closely as a watched pot never boils.
6.
When water and/or salt gets hot enough, it will boil.
7.
Water is boiling when large bubbles come to the top and it makes a boiling sound (it is not yet boiling when tiny bubbles come up).
8.
Further heating will only result in evaporation and (heaven forbid) burning water.
9.
Add salt.
10.
Always add your salt after the water begins to boil to avoid pitting your cookware.
11.
Heating the water to a gentle boil improves the final dish.
12.
Serve hot or at room temperature.
13.
Freezes well.

Stir in the flour, coconut, oats, and apricots.
Place level tbsps of the mixture onto baking trays, leaving room between each one to spread.
You'll get about 8 on most trays, so you'll need to cook them in batches.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until they start to turn golden at the edges.
Leave on the tray to cool for 5 minutes - this will help them firm up as they'll be very soft when they come out of the oven.
Remove to a wire tray and continue to cook the rest of the dough.

In a large preheated skillet on medium heat add the ingredients sequentially to the pan.
Toast large items first, and work towards the smaller.
This keeps things from burning.
Keep the pan pretty hot, and always moving.
t can be done quickly, or slowly.
It's safer to stir than to pan flip.
The point is to toast evenly, quickly, and to get some real heat into the mass without burning for the presentation --
Add to hot pan:.
1.5 cups organic rolled oats.
.5 cups organic rolled barley.
1 tablespoon butter (quickly stir in to avoid burning).
Toast for approximately 5 minutes.
STIR STIR STIR.

Spread out the kale in a single, even layer on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 4 to 6 minutes, until chips have turned patchy brown and green.
Leave your oven light on, and check them constantly.
Remove the chips at the edges of the baking sheets as they brown.
The ones in the center may take a bit longer to cook.
Let them cool for a few minutes before munching away; this allows the sugar to harden and the slightly soft parts of the chips to become crispy.
Enjoy!



Combine all of the ingredients in a pot and stir to coat the carrots evenly.
Set over a medium flame and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes or until tender.



Line two 12 cup mini muffin tins with mini muffin cups and set aside.
Melt the white chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl for 1 minute.
Stir in peanut butter and microwave for an additional 30 seconds if needed.
The mixture should only be half melted so it kind of stays together when you are layering it between the melted chocolate.
Make sure to use potholders when grabbing the bowl from the microwave.
My bowls were so hot I almost dropped one!
Next, melt the milk chocolate in the microwave in 30 to 40 second intervals until creamy and smooth.
Stir out all the lumps or bubbles.
Drop the melted milk chocolate evenly along the 24 cups, reserving half of the chocolate for the top layer.
Shake the pans a little to even out the first layer.
Next drop in a layer of the peanut butter mixture into the center of the chocolate.
I used about a 1/2 teaspoon to 3/4 of a teaspoon.
Then top off cups with remaining melted milk chocolate and chopped peanuts and put into the freezer for 15 minutes.
They will be perfectly formed and ready to serve!
You can keep these little guys in an air-tight container for up to two weeks.

Combine olive oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk.
Stir in edamame, radishes, and chives.



In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in the lukewarm water and then sprinkle the yeast over the water.
Allow to sit for 10 minutes.
After the 10 minutes is up, add the salt, oil and 1/2 cup of flour, stir until smooth.
Add another 1/2 cup of flour and stir again, if the mixture is still very sticky, add in a little more flour and begin to knead the dough.
Knead for about 5 minutes, adding more flour if needed, until the dough becomes soft and elastic.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle a nonstick cookie sheet with cornmeal and then stretch the pizza crust to cover the bottom of the cookie sheet.
Bake the crust without toppings for about 10-12 minutes until the crust is baked through and the bottom is getting golden brown.
Remove crust from the oven and top first with the brie and then with the peaches and sprinkle the top with the chopped basil.
Bake for another 10-12 minutes until the crust is browned and the cheese is melted.

The dough will be thick and shaggy.
Think Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap.
Let dough rest at room temperature for at least 12 hours, but to 18 or 20 hours.
Seriously.
The dough is ready when it is swollen and bubbly all over the top.
Think lunar surface.
Spread 1/4 to 1/3 cup of additional flour on a smooth work surface.
Dump the dough onto the floured surface.
Have a scraper handy because its pretty gooey and will stick to the bowl.
Sprinkle the top of the dough with a little more flour.
Using a bench scraper or spatula, lift up one side of the dough, give it a good stretch skyward and fold it over the rest of dough.
Repeat this process 2-3 times trying not to deflate the dough too much.
Flour up you hands and get ready to shape the dough in loaves or rolls on the floury surface.
For rolls, divide the dough in half, halve again, and divide each quarter into thirds.
For loaves, divide dough in half and create rounded or oblong free-form shapes.
Work as gently as possible so as not to deflate dough very much.
Place these little gems on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Dust loaves/rolls with flour and cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise for 30 minutes while you pre-heat your oven to 475 degrees (F).
The oven does need to be good and hot.
A few minutes before its time to put the bread in the oven, put a pie pan filled with 1/2 1 inches of water on the bottom rack.
This creates steam a turbo boost for the bread and creates a great crust.
Bake bread on middle rack till its a fine, nutty brown about 15 minutes for rolls and about 20 minutes for loaves.
Bottoms of your bread should be browned as well.
Cool on a rack, and as tempting as it may be to tear into your bread while warm, its actually way better once it cools.
You have been warned.

Do this slowly on a low to medium heat to prevent burning.
Once the milk has reached 175 F, turn off the heat and immediately stir in the buttermilk and lemon juice.
You will notice the curds forming almost immediately.
Allow approximately 10 to 15 minutes for all the curds to form.
When the curds finish forming, scoop them into a colander lined with a double layer of cheese cloth.
Create a pouch and hang the cheese so it can continue to strain.
Hang the homemade cheese for 1 24 hours depending on the desired texture (it will be ready to eat in about an hour).
After the cheese is done hanging, unwrap it, place it in a bowl, and mix in salt and pepper.
This would also be the time to add other flavors such as herbs, garlic, or spices.

(Did you know that the most used ingredient in cooking is Air?
).
Make a well in the centre and add most of the Buttermilk or Substitute ;-).
Continue mixing with the fork until the dough comes together and is soft but not sticky.
Add more milk if it's getting to dry or if to sticky add a little more flour.
With floured hands lift out the dough onto a floured surface and shape into a round.
Do not kneed the dough to much or you will get a Hockey Puck.

Pour this mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Make the oatmeal streusel by grinding the rolled oats to a fine flour using a food processor.
A blender will also work.
Combine the oat flour with 2 tablespoons brown sugar, all-purpose flour, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl.
Cut the cold butter into the dry mixture using a pastry knife or a fork.
You should have a crumbly mixture with pea-size bits.
Sprinkle this oatmeal streusel over the sweet potato mixture and pop it into the oven for 70 to 80 minutes or until the top begins to brown slightly.
When you remove the casserole from the oven immediately spread the marshmallows over the top.
Let this sit for about 10 minutes.
The heat from the casserole will melt the marshmallows, and then it's ready to serve.



1.
Combine the flour and salt in a food processor.
Add the shortening; pulse the machine on and off until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
2.
With the machine running, trickle in 4 tablespoons of ice water through the feed tube, until the dough just gathers together.
(If the dough seems dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more of ice water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time.)
Divide the dough in half, forming each half into a thick disk.
Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill.
3.
Remove half the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface or between 2 sheets of wax paper to form a circle about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pie plate.
(Work quickly, as the dough can become sticky.)
With the help of a spatula, gently transfer the dough to a pie plate, pressing it lightly into the plate to fit.
If the dough should tear, just press it together gently.
Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang.
If making a single-crust pie, turn the edge under and flute it decoratively.
4.
Repeat for a top crust or for another bottom crust.
The circle for a top crust should be 9 inches for an 8-inch pie and 10 inches for a 9-inch pie.
5.
Follow the individual pie recipes for filling and baking.

Preheat the oven to 375F Butter 4 individual casserole dishes.
(If you choose to make one large crisp, you'll increase baking time by about 10 minutes.)
I often forget the butter.
No biggie.
I love to cook, but hate doing dishes, so I make this all in one pot.
In a medium pot (NO HEAT!)
combine apples and lemon juice and toss well to coat.
Add in the rest of the filling ingredients, brown sugar, white sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.
Stir well to combine, breaking up any lumps of sugar or flour.
Pour equal amounts of apple mixture into the four casseroles.
They should be about half full.
Set aside.
In the same pan (see?
one less bowl to wash!)
melt the butter over medium lo heat.
Once butter is melted, turn off heat.
Add in remaining topping ingredients: oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and nuts if you're using them.
Stir to combine well, again, breaking up any obvious lumps of sugar or flour.
**The topping should not be "wet", but if it seems TOO dry, and the butter does not seem to have coated all of the oats, then add in an additional tablespoon of butter.
It won't hurt anything.
Pour mixture equally over the apples in each dish.
They should be almost full, but not overflowing.
Place the dishes on a cookie sheet, just in case the filling does overflow.
Bake for 30 minutes (40 if you're making one big crisp).
Allow to cool, serve with milk, whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream.



Blend dry ingredients, rub in shortening.
Add warm water (40C, 105F), mix until smooth.

Place in a large greased bowl and cover.
(I use a cloth towel.)
Let sit in warm area until doubled in size.
Approximately 45 minutes.
(Optional for fluffier crust: Punch down dough ball and let rise until doubled in size again.
).
Oven and pizza stone need preheated at least 20 minutes at 500 degrees with 1 rack 2nd row from top and 1 on the bottom.

Place the first five ingredients in the bowl and mix.
Add: 2 Cups 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour.
(to cool the water and end up with warm dough) Mix then add 2 Tbs of Dry Active Yeast.
If your not sure about your yeast proof it in a little warm water first.
Add: 4 Cups of 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour.
Mix until the consistency is some what even.
Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl.
It should be tacky to the touch.
The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy.
It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour.
You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish.
Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.
When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes.
The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.
Grease two bread pans with Crisco.
You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.
Mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size.
Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it.
Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky.
Divide the ball in half and do it again.
Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over.
When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top.
Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes.
If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes.
(gas oven).
When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool.
You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled.
(Condensation will make it soggy) Put in tinfoil to store on the counter.
If you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick.
Enjoy.

Wrap the jar in a towel or blanket and place in a styrofoam cooler or haybox.
Be sure it is wrapped tight without any room for air to circulate around the jars.
Pack it snug.
Let the yogurt incubate in the box for 9 hours.
Remove the jars from the hay box and place in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
Note: You can add a couple T of your favorite fruit jam in the bottom of the glass jars before pouring the unset yogurt mixture into the jars.
Save a bit of the yogurt from this batch to use as the starter for your next batch - so you dont have to buy the Dannon Yogurt again.
Well, at least not for a while.
Eventually you might want to start with a fresh starter as the taste will get stronger with each batch (about every third or fourth time).
You can buy a large container of Dannon Yogurt and freeze the unused portion in icecube trays to use for later yogurt batches.
Chill.

TOMATO PREPARATION ALL METHODS.
Cut out the stem and scar and the hard portion of core lying under it.
Cut the tomatoes in half, lengthwise.
If the tomato is more than about 2 inches long, cut it in quarters.
Scrape out all of the seeds that you can without removing the pulp.
Mix together thoroughly basil,oregano, thyme, and salt.
Sprinkle a small amount of this mixture on each tomato.
OVEN-DRYING (approximately 12 hours).
Arrange the tomatoes, with the cut surface up, on non-stick cookie sheets (glass or porcelain dishes are OK.) Do not use aluminum foil or aluminum baking sheets as the acid in the tomato will react with the metal.
Bake in 170F oven for about 3 hours.
Leave the oven door propped open about 3 inches to allow moisture to escape.
After 3 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat with your hand or a spatula.
Continue to dry, turning the tomatoes every few hours, and gently pressing flatter and flatter, until tomatoes are dry.
DEHYDRATOR (approximately 8 hours):.
Place the tomatoes, cut side up, directly onto the dehydrator trays.
Set dehydrator temperature to about 140F.
After 4 or 5 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat with your hand or a spatula.
After a few hours, turn the tomatoes again and flatten gently.
Continue drying until done.
SUN-DRYING (approximately 3 days):.
Dry in hot weather, with relatively low humidity.
Place tomatoes, cut side down, in shallow wood-framed trays with nylon netting for the bottom of the trays.
Cover trays with protective netting or cheesecloth.
Place in direct sun, raised from the ground.
on blocks or anything else that allows air to circulate under the trays.
Turn the tomatoes over after about 1 1/2 days, to expose the cut side to the sun.
Place the trays in a sheltered spot after sundown, or if the weather turns bad.
ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR ALL METHODS.
No matter what method you choose, be aware that not all of the tomatoes will dry at the same rate.
They do not all have the same amount of moisture, nor do they experience the same temperature and air circulation while they are drying.
They are done when they are very dry, but still pliable.
Texture is about that of a dried apricot.
If dried too long, they become tough and leathery.
If not dried long enough, they will mold and mildew, unless packed in oil.
So watch them carefully while they dry.
Try to remove them on an individual basis, before they become tough.



Preheat oven to 425.
Slice potatoes wafer thin, using vegetable slicer or food processor.
Drop potato slices into cold water to avoid discoloration.

place in microwave for another 10 minutes, removing every 2 mins to stir again.
remove from microwave and let the burfi set
when it is half set, cut into small square pieces or squares of desired size



Place the flour, butter, and salt in a food processor fitted with a steel blade.
Pulse about 24 times, then open the machine and lift a nadful of crumbs.
The largest pieces of butter should be the size of raw grains of rice or barley, if larger, pulse again.
When the butter pieces are the correct size, transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.
Sprinkle 6 Tbs of ice water onto the dough.
Spread the fingers of one hand, and using your rigid fingertips as if they were a large fork, stir the dough quickly and briefly until the liquid is incorporated.
Squeeze a handful of the dough in your palm; the dough should have just enough moisture to stay together.
Break the piece in half; if it seems dry and crumbly, cautiously add more water a few tsp at a time until you can squeeze it into a ball that will not brumble when broken apart.
The dough is easiest to work with immediately if your kitchen is reasonably cool, the butter was cold and you used ice water.
If your kitchen is very warm, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 15 minute.
Turn the pastry dough out on a lightly floured board and divide it inot quarters for small 7-inch tart shells or in half for large 10-inch shells.
Shape 1 piece of dough into a disk and dust the top lightly with flour.
Begin to roll out the dough, using quick but gentle strokes with the pin.
Start with the pin in the middle of the round and roll to the top, then the bottom.
Rotate the dough 1/4 turn each time you roll to be sure the dough is not sticking and use additional flour as necessary.
When the round is larger than 9 inches for a small tart or 12 inches for a large tart and about 1/8-inch thick.
Trim the edges of the rounds if you want, but the edge is hand formed so it really doesn't matter all that much.
Fold 1/2-inch edge of dough all around to form a decorative rim.
Begin by folding a 1-inch long section over by 1/2 inch, then overlap the fold by half and roll another piece of dough over, pinching it firmly in place.
Continue to roll and pinch, and a twisted rop pattern will form.
Roll out the remaining dough in the same way, and crimp edges in the same manner.
Transfer the pastry shells to baking sheets lined with parchment paper and poke the interior of the shells all over with the tines of a fork.
Refrigerate the pastry for at least 30 min or up to 24 hours.
They can be frozen on the baking sheets, and when frozen, stack them inside freezer bags.
Bake the shells without thawing.
Prebaking:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Brush the rims of the tarts with an egg wash.
Bake 1 baking sheet at a time for 15 min, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until they are an even golden brown, 8-12 min longer.
Lift a shell with a spatula and check that the underside is evenly brown.
If the tart shells puff up during baking, press down the center of the pastry with the back of a large spoon.
Let cool on the baking sheet.



Sift together the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.
Work the shortening into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender, until the mixture is the consistency of coarse meal.
Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix with a fork after each addition.
Dough should not be wet, but just moist enough to hold together.
Form the dough into a ball.
Wrap and refrigerate for at least 15 to 30 minutes before rolling.

Combine all ingredients, blending well.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
*This recipe makes about 1 cup of butter.
*



Whisk all ingredients together in a small bowl till well combined.
This recipe yields about 1/3 c. of dressing.



Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.



In a casserole dish add, sugar,flour,baking powder, and soda mix with a fork to blend then add milk.
Stir until everything is incorporated.
In a seperate bowl mix water, sugar, and nutmeg.
Using a large spoon pour the water mixture over the spoon and onto the dough mixture gently so as not to disurb the dough.
Place in oven and bake for 1/2 hour.
Cake will bake and rise above the sauce mixture.



Mix all ingredients except color either by hand or a stand mixer.
Knead until smooth and gluten has developed, add in water of flour as needed.
Dough will be soft and sticky, as this is how rye dough feels It makes a tacky dough, not like white!
This takes about 7'10 minutes.
Put dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and let rise until it is puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove, divide in half.
Knead the color into one half.
Roll each half into a 8x11 inch rectangle.
Put one on top of the other, I put the lighter one on the bottom so the lighter color is the outside of the finished loaf.
You, of course can decide for yourself!
Roll into a loaf, jelly roll style, starting with the 8' side, tuck ends inches.
You can either make a free form loaf and put on a parchment lined sheet pan or use a large lightly oiled bread pan.
In either case, cover with a damp towel or a piece of lightly spayed cling film.
Let rise until doubled, approximately 1-11/2.
In the meantime preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Place the bread in, bake for 15 minutes, reduce heat to 350 and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, until it has an internal temperature of 190 F, or sounds hollow when tapped.
Remove and cool completely on a wire rack.
You can easily omit the dry milk, it is only there for nutrition and it makes for a more tender crumb.
Also, the coffee is only to darken one half, so you get the different colors.
You can't taste it!
Some recipes call for cocoa,which I think you can taste, others for caramel coloring.
I simply think instant coffee is easier.

Ladies, get your aprons on.

Serve this with a Thai sweet/warm chili sauce.
Had it like which in Bangkok and it was one of the best meals I had there.
This recipe sounds too easy to be true.
It isn'teaspoon As with any grilled seafood, the fresher the ingredients and the simpler the cooking, the better the end result.
Barbecued squid and an anise flavored aperitif like Pernod, ricard, ouzo or possibly raki, make a wonderful combination.
Make a fire, preferably with firewood or possibly Mexican charcoal, started from paper and kindling.
Skewer the squid.
When coals are red warm, barbecue the rings for 2 to 3 min per side, or possibly till they are brown.
Some recipes for grilled squid suggest marinating them.
I omit this procedure because it adds flavor at the expense of softening the flesh.
Serve warm with lemon-garlic butter.
NOTE: Commercial charcoal and lighter fluid are petroleum products.
They impart an oily flavor to food.
Hardwood, or possibly Mexican charcoal, a commercial product, that is made by burning down mesquite, both give a nice flavor and are certainly less toxic than petrochemicals.
Mexican charcoal is available in Northern California through Lazzari Fuel Company, San Francisco.

Pour into prepared tin.
Bung in the oven and cook for 45 minutes (test with skewer and if dry o'kay) if not could require up to another 15 minutes.
Don't ask me why but it always takes somewhere between 45 to 60 minutes to cook and never the same twice and I've been cooking it for 25 years.



Peel, boil then rice the potatoes.
Scald milk then add the butter, sugar and salt.
Add this into the HOT riced potatoes and mix well.

Add enough flour to make a stiff dough.
Pinch off walnut size portions and roll THIN.
Bake on lefse iron or large griddle.
Watch carefully, so not to burn them, it only takes a minute for this step.
When you see the lefse start to bubble and turn a light brown, flip and bake the other side.
Lay it on top of waxed paper and keep stacking them up.
Keep a piece of waxed paper on top to keep them from drying out.
Store in airtight container.
Butter and sprinkles lightly with sugar, roll up and eat.
If needed; when you're ready to eat place lefse between damp dishtowels to soften, about 15 minutes.
Potato Lefse is harder to handle then Milk Lefse at the rolling out and baking stage.



In a medium bowl, whisk together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sugar, olive oil, vinegar, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and onion.

Measure flour and salt into bowl.
Add oil; mix with a fork, until particals are the size of small peas.
Sprinkle with water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until flour is moistened and dough almost cleans the sides of the bowl.
(If dough seems too dry, 1 to 2 tablespoons oil can be added.
Do not add water.If dough seems a bit too wet, add a tiny bit of additional flour).Gather dough together;PRESS FIRMLY INTO A BALL.
After pressing firmly into a ball,the less the dough is handled the more flaky the crust will be.
Divide dough in half ; place one half cut side down and flatten into a round.
Roll each round of dough between two sheets of wax paper.
Gently peel off one sheet of wax paper and turn dough upside down.
Peel off remaining sheet of wax paper after placing bottom crust into pan leaving a 1/2 inch overlap around pan edge.
( Fill with desired pie filling.)
Repeat with top crust rolling out same as bottom crust leaving 1 inch overhang around pan edge).
Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on the rim to seal; flute edges as desired.
Cut slits to vent steam in top of pie.
I usually moisten my hands with a little water and dab across top crust.
Sprinkle a tiny bit of sugar across the top of the pie, but not on the fluted areas of crust.
Bake as directed following your pie recipe.
*Do not use quick mixing flour in this recipe.
If using self-rising flour,omit the salt.
Pie crusts made with self-rising flour will differ in flavor and texture from those made with regular flour.
(I always use regular flour.
).
Lots of people say they can't make a good pie crust.
You can using this recipe,just work with the dough.
It may take a time or two, until you become used to making the dough and working with it.
Just remember to press the dough into a firm ball before rolling it out between the wax paper sheets.
Another small bonus for me is that it uses oil instead of hydrogenated fats.



Blend the strawberries, sugar, honey and lemon juice with 2 cups ice.
Add the remaining ice and blend until completely smooth.
Pour the mixture into a 9x13 baking dish and freeze for 30 minutes.
Scrape with a fork until slushy.

Mix the margarine bars.
It's important to use softened margarine otherwise the dough will be too sticky.
Slowly add the flour, mix until it's almost well combined, let a bit of flour aside to roll the dough later and to add to the cookies sheet if it's needed.
Add the sugar and mix until well combined.
Add the pecans and mix well.
Roll the dough if needed, it shouldn't be sticky at this point.
Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees C-220 degrees C.

Leave the butter at room temperature to soften.
Mix the butter with sugar and cream them until the sugar dissolves completely.
When the mixture is fluffy, add the milk little by little and whisk constantly until you obtain a texture like mayonnaise.
Sift the flour twice beforehand and sift it into the butter mixture.
Mix quickly with a plastic spatula.
At first the mixture looks crumbly but it gradually starts to look like stiff cream.
Put the mixture into a piping bag and pipe the mixture out by starting in the centre and going around outwards to make rose shapes.
Bake in the pre-heated oven to 170C (338 Fahrenheit) for 15 to 20 minutes.
Check the colour now and then.
After baking leave to cool and put transfer to a storing jar.
Left: rose-shaped cookies by me.
Right: cherry-blossom-shaped cookies by my daughter
When you put the cookie dough into a piping bag it is easier to do so by putting the piping bag in a large cup.
When you buy cream tubs plastic nozzles come as a free gifts.
You can use them with this recipe.
I showed how to pipe the cookie dough in detail in.
One Cookpad user made these cookies using food colouring for rose-shaped cookies.
They look very passionate and beautiful, don't they?
Another Cookpad user made these using cocoa powder.
They're good for Valentine's day.
A zoomed-up photo of a rose shape.
Take it easy when you're squeezing the dough out.
There's no need to panic!
It should be just like coaxing the dough around in a circular motion.
I used cream for the first time in a long time but the resultant cookies were quite hard.
It might be caused of being whipped too much?
Milk is better to handle.
In winter the dough is harder so it might be difficult to pipe out.
Rub the dough while it is in the bag to soften it.
At Step 2 the the texture you want is like one of mayonnaise.
When it is cold the butter hardens, so warm it over a bain-marie if necessary.
Do not melt it, though.



Melt butter in large bowl in the microwave.

Wash the tomatoes and bring a large pot of water to a boil.
When the water is boiling, submerge the tomatoes for a few seconds to scald them and remove to a bowl of cold water to stop the tomaotes from cooking.
Peel them, cut in half and remove seeds.
Weigh them-for every 6 pounds of tomato pulp, you'll need 6 cups sugar and 2 cups water.
Put the water and sugar in a pot on the stove top.
Stir over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved in the water, making a syrup.
Bring the syrup to a boil, add the 6 lbs.
tomatoes, and cook for 15-20 minutes, lowering the heat to a simmer.
Be sure to watch the pot so that it doesn't boil over-it gets foamy!
The foam can be skimmed off the top.
After 20 minutes, turn the stove off and let the mixture sit for a few hours.
After a few hours, re-heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, taking care that it doesn't stick or burn.
Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let cook for 1-2 hours, stirring periodically.
After this time, the tomatoes should have a shininess and transparent look.
Stir and taste for sugar, adding more if necessary for your taste.

Try to get all of the flour off the bottom of the bowl.
Then, mix in the other half of the whipped cream and fold in very gently.
Lightly flour a work surface, and carefully pour the mixture out onto the surface.
The dough will probably still be a bit wet, with dry bits of flour here and there.
Flour your hands, and carefully shape the dough into a 1 inch thick rectangle.
Then, fold the dough in half over itself and flip it over.
It should start to become somewhat moldable.
If it seems too wet still, sprinkle a touch of flour on the top and shape and fold again.
However, dont do this too many times or youll kill the advantage of whipping your cream first.
Once it will basically hold together, form a 3x16 rectangle about an inch or so thick.
Cut the rectangle into triangles (about 10 to 12).
Lift scones and place onto the parchment very close together.
They should almost be touching, but not quite... maybe 1/4 or 1/8 of an inch between.
This will help them keep their shape.

To make a cheesecake crust: Use 100 g graham crackers and 40 g melted butter.
Put crackers into a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin.
After crushing the crackers in a bag using a rolling pin, add melted butter.
Use a potato masher to flatten into the cake pan.
Be sure to pack it tightly, so that it won't crumble when baked.
When using butter to make the graham cracker dough, I recommend cutting it up into cubes, then freezing them in the freezer.
I made rare cheesecake.
I crushed the crackers very finely and layered at the bottom, sprinkled more on top, and added a cracker for decoration.
This rare cheesecake is a mousse-type that doesn't harden.

Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl and let sit until foaming, 5-10 minutes.
Meanwhile, sift flours into a separate bowl (discard whole wheat dregs).
When yeast is foaming, add flours, salt, cool water, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Mix with a wooden spoon until combined, adding water or flour as needed to bring dough together into a ball.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes.
Place in a bowl greased with the remaining tablespoon of oil.
Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot.
Let rise until doubled, about 1.5-2 hours (the longer the better, but put in the fridge if its going to be more than 3 hours).
When its doubled, split the dough ball into two pieces on a lightly floured surface.
If you only need one small pie, the other ball can be frozen at this point.
Cover remaining dough ball with plastic wrap or a towel and let rest until slightly puffed, about 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees (place a pizza stone on the bottom rack if you have one).
Press the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness with your hands, letting it rest periodically so it doesnt tear or snap back into place too quickly.

Dump berries onto a medium cookie sheet.
Sprinkle a bit of the remaining 1/2 of sugar over the berries.
Slide the cookie sheet back and forth over the surface of a table or counter so that the berries roll around in the sugar.
Continue adding sugar a bit at a time to cover berries evenly and thoroughly.
Allow berries to rest for 1-2 hours on the counter to allow the simple syrup to begin forming a hard shell.
Sprinkle with additional sugar to cover any final sticky spots.
Serve as-is, as a cocktail garnish, as a topping for cheesecake, or in any other way you can imagine.

Put the olive oil and vegetable oil in a clean, dry, medium-sized pot over a medium heat.
Heat until the oil for approximately 1-2 minutes, or until a test almond dropped in the oil starts to slowly emit a stream of bubbles.
Ready a plate lined with paper towels and a slotted spoon and add the almonds to the oil.
Fry the almonds, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.
When they start to emit a toasty aroma and are a medium-brown, remove the pan from the heat and start removing them from the pan.
Some of the nuts in the pan may start to crack as you work.
When that happens, move quickly, since they will burn if you leave them in the oil too long.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the almonds from the oil and put them on the lined plate to drain.
Allow the almonds to cool away from the range.
Some of them might be slightly cracked, but over all they should be aromatic and smell a bit like toast.
While the nuts are cooling, put a medium saute pan over a medium-high heat.
Put the butter in the pan.
When it has started melting, add the curry powder and chopped rosemary to the pan.
Stir.
When the butter mixture is foaming and the curry powder and rosemary aromas become much stronger, remove the pan from the heat.
Add the fried almonds to the butter mixture and toss to coat.
Add the Maldon salt.
Put the almonds in a heatproof bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Serve while warm topped with a sprig of rosemary, and a gritty who-done-it.



Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in about a half cup of the lukewarm water.
Let stand until frothy.
Sift the flour together with the salt and add the yeast mixture.
Knead by hand until the dough is soft, adding water as necessary.
Add the oil and keep kneading until the dough becomes elastic and is no longer sticky, which should take about 15 minutes.
Now form the dough into a ball and rub all over with a little bit of olive oil, to prevent it from drying out.
Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Punch down and knead for another five minutes or so.
Now break the dough into tennis-ball sized portions.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and roll flat, until each ball is about a quarter inch thick.
Dust with flour and transfer to a lightly floured surface, leaving a few inches between each one to allow for rising.
Let rise for another 30 to 60 minutes.
Oil two large baking sheets.
Preheat your oven to 500 degrees.
About 10 minutes into the preheating, put the sheets in the oven.
Leave them there for another 10 minutes.

Use a variety of apples.
Gala apples are especially good for giving the sauce its rosy hue.
There are no set measurements to this recipeif you only have 6 apples and you want to use just a little water, use your judgement.
This is a great way to use cooking apples if you do not feel like baking.
I used gala, Macintosh, golden delicious, red delicious and other apples I was not very familiar with that were given to me from an orchard .
Wash well , quarter and roughly cut out the core of the apples.
Place apples in a saucepan with a cup of water.
Bring to a boil and simmer until apples are mushy.
Note: once you add the water, they should not be covered at all.
You are using the water to steam the apples, so that they do not scorch.
If while cooking it seems like there is too much water, just drain of a little bit of water.
Give a stir to the pot occasionally.
When the apples cool down, pass the mixture through a coarse sieve, pressing down with the back of a spatula, discarding the skins.
If there is any liqiud left in the saucepan, add it to the applesauce only if the texture is too thick.
Otherwise, drink it up .
Enjoy with granola, on its own, or with roast pork and turkey.

Serve potatoes warm or at room temperature, drizzled with vinaigrette.



Find a good sealing glass jar- An old spaghetti sauce jar with lid works nicely.
Please note that the above amounts are approximate, depending on the size jar you use- and how much you'd like to make.
Fill the jar halfway with uber-ripe raspberries.
Fill the rest of the way with sugar cubes.
Pour Vodka into the jar up to the top.
SEAL the jar, and shake for 10-15 seconds, and then place the jar somewhere you'll be sure to see it every day- out of direct sunlight.
Shake the jar for 10-15 seconds EVERY DAY for about 6 weeks- You'll notice the berries break up more, and the sugar will totally dissolve over time.
(It is helpful to mark the end date on your calendar- if you go over, it's no big deal).
AT THE END OF THE 6 WEEKS, open the jar and strain the Raspberry Schnapps through cheesecloth; I like to tightly rubber band the cheesecloth around the opening and let it drain for a few hours.
After it has drained, you may gently squeeze the extra juice out of the fruit; Try not to over-squeeze, or you'll get fruit as well.
STORAGE: You may store this in a clean glass jar; What I like to do is store the schnapps in a pretty glass decanter with a stopper you could find at a thrift store- and while you're there, you can probably find some Schnapps Glasses!
They look like teeny wine glasses- Some have longer stems than others.
SERVING TIPS: Serve at room temperature in Schnapps glasses, if you have them; If not, pour a small amount into a wine glass and enjoy.
NOTE: You may substitute Loganberries, Marionberries, or whatever kinds of berries or fruit as you wish.

Roll the log in baking paper and twist the ends.
Chill in the refrigerator until firm enough to slice.
The mixture can also be frozen at this stage.
Preheat your oven to 180C
Cut the log into slices about 5mm thick and place the discs on paper-lined oven trays.
No need to grease the trays.
Bake 12-15 minutess or until golden.
Remove from the oven and rest on the oven trays for a few minutes (to firm) and then transfer to a wire rack to cool.

After cooling crust: Melt chocolate chips and peanut butter.
Mix together well.
Spread on top of cooled crust.
Cut into squares.



Mix all ingredients and either mould into scone shapes or roll out and use a cutter, or just cut into squares after rolling out.
When sitting on the oven tray - place them close together so that they rise up higher and don't have crusts because they are all touching.
Cook in a 200C oven for 15-20 minutes.



Pour the vodka into a large, sterilised Kilner jar or similar container.
Add the blackberries and the sugar, then seal tightly and give the jar a good shake.
Leave in a cook, dark place for 3 days to allow the flavours to infuse, shaking daily.
Strain the berries and vodka through a fine sieve lined with a muslin or a new, clean, damp, J cloth.
(it's important that the fine debris in the mixture is removed from the liquid, otherwise it will ferment and spoil the vodka.)
You may have to do this a few times to remove all traces of the fruit.
Pour the vodka into sterlised bottles or jam jars and seal them securely.
Keep chilled and consume within 8 weeks.



Fill your Vita-mix or other blender 1/3 full of softened Laura Soybeans that have soaked in water overnight.
Add water to fill blender to within 2 inches of top.
Puree the soybeans as thoroughly as your blender will grind.
This is your soy milk.Do not strain this milk, leave the tiny pieces of soybean in the soy milk.
Pour this unstrained soy milk into a pot and heat up to 180 degrees for 20 minutes.Stir occasionally to prevent scorching --in case you allow heat to get too high.
Monitor the temp with any common meat thermometer and try not to go over 180 degrees.
After milk has cooked remove from heat and gently stir your coagulant of choice into the cooked soy milk and allow it to curd.
Place a piece of cheesecloth over a strainer and pour the curded soy milk into the strainer allowing the whey to drain away.
Press out excess whey and spoon the tofu into a plastic food storage container and refrigerate.
I like to lightly sprinkle salt over the top of the tofu and cover with a thin layer of water and store.

Coarsely chop the dates with a lightly oiled knife.
Place in a heavy pot and add the pecans, sugar, and water and cook over low-medium heat, stirring, until the dates have fallen apart and you can see the bottom of the pot when scraped with a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.
The mixture will be thick and you will feel it in your arm!
Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, dampen 2 large pieces (about 14 by 18 inches) of cheesecloth, and squeeze out the excess water.
Lay out one of the cheesecloths and spread one-fourth of the mixture along the bottom (centered).
Roll tightly into a log and remove the cheesecloth.
Repeat with the remaining mixture to roll 3 more logs.
(Use the second cheesecloth if the first one becomes too sticky or breaks.)
Roll the logs in sugar and wrap well in plastic wrap, then put inside a resealable bag.
Keep in a cool, dry area.
The rolls can last up to 3 months stored this way.
They may seem hard at first but once you slice them, youll see they are still delicious.

Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl.
Stir with one hand to blend.
Add the shortening, breaking it into 2 or 3 manageable chunks.
To combine the ingredients, pick up some flour and shortening and quickly rub it between your hands in a gentle sliding motion from the heel of your hand to your fingertips.
Work over the bowl so that the mixture falls back into the bowl.
Continue picking up and rubbing more of the mixture until you no longer see lumps of shortening.
This process takes less than 1 minute.
Work in the water, one-third at a time, using your fingers or a spatula to moisten the flour mixture after each addition.
When all the water has been incorporated, you should be able to press the ragged mass of dough and all the bits into a ball.
Transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface; it should not stick.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes, until it is relatively smooth and somewhat elastic.
Push your finger into the dough; it should slowly bounce back with a noticeable dent left behind.
Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours before using.
(The dough can be refrigerated overnight.
Return to room temperature before using.)

Pour desired amount of oatmeal into cereal bowl.
(I suggested 1/2 cup, but any amount is fine.
However, if you use much more than this, you will probably want to use a larger bowl so the oatmeal doesn't boil over before it is fully done).
Add enough water to just cover the oatmeal.
(1/2 cup water if you are using 1/2 cup of oatmeal).
Microwave on high for about 2 minutes.
(The actual time will vary depending on the microwave.
I let it go until a volcano forms.
I turn the microwave off just before the volcano erupts over the side of the bowl.
I then let it sit in the microwave for about a minute, but it's not necessary.

Use edges of foil to lift the brownies out of the pan.



In a medium skillet, combine the mango, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Over medium high heat, bring the liquid to a boil.
Lower the heat to medium and stir the mixture constantly for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.
In a small saucepan, warm the rum over low heat and stir in the cornstarch mixture until it thickens.
Transfer the sauce to a heatproof bowl.
Bring the mango sauce and the pan of warm rum to the table and spoon ice cream into six individual bowls.
Light the rum in the pan and pour it, still flaming, into the mango sauce.
Spoon some of the mango sauce over each dish of ice cream.



Optional: Soak cranberries in the orange juice to plump them while you make the dough, for a few minutes, a few hours, or overnight before starting the recipe.
Mix dry ingredients together, then cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Stir in orange juice and cranberries.
Mix lightly until dough comes together.
If it seems too dry, add more orange juice, but just one spoonful at a time.
Texture should be like biscuit dough.
Don't overmix.
Dump the dough out on an oiled or floured surface.
Oil or flour your hands, pat the dough together, then divide into four balls.
Place each ball on an ungreased cookie sheet (or use a little cooking spray, just on the spots where you place the dough), then smooth and flatten each one to a 6-inch round about 1 inch thick.
Sprinkle rounds with sugar if desired (it makes the tops sparkly--I use demerara sugar if I have it).
Using an oiled knife, cut each round into 6 wedges.
Bake at 425 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Let cool on pan for a few minutes, then use a small serrated knife to separate the scones and transfer them to a rack or cloth-lined basket.
You can also make drop scones by dropping spoonfuls of dough onto a cookie sheet.
(I like to use an ice cream scoop--the kind that will push the dough out.
It makes them round and consistently sized.)
These don't bake so long (maybe 15 minutes), so watch them closely.
I have normally made these in a heavy-duty mixer (Bosch), and when I had to make them by hand, it was much more challenging to avoid over-mixing while getting enough liquid incorporated.
The finished texture was quite different.
I had to bake them longer because they were doughy in the middle, and then they got too brown.
So perhaps if you don't have a mixer, you should pat them thinner (maybe 3/4 inch) and add a little more baking powder to help the rise.



Mix, cut in butter till coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle over pie and bake till golden.



put all indgrediants into blendar.
puree all indgrediants for 15 miniutes.
chill 5 hours or overnight.



Basil -- This is the key - blanch your basil leaves.
Bring a small pot of water up to a medium boil and add the leaves for 20 seconds.
Remove immediately from the pot and add to a small bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process and to retain the bright green color.
It only takes a minute to cool off the basil.
Remove from the water bath to a paper towel and make sure you let the basil dry off before you make the oil.
Oil -- Add your basil and garlic to the blender and pulse a couple of times to start the puree.
Then slowly drizzle in the olive oil with the blender on until smooth and creamy.
Just enjoy it!

Prepare to have the ice water handy by filling a Pyrex measuring cup with water and ice cubes.
Set it by your work area, and let it get icy cold.
Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl.
With a pastry cutter (or two knives), cut the shortening in until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs.
Take out the pastry cutter and, while stirring with a fork, add 1 Tablespoon ice cold water at a time until the dough is sticky and comes together.
If the weather (or your kitchen) is warm/humid, less water will be needed.
Be sure you have the consistency you want, because it's very difficult to add more water.
Form half the dough into a ball with your hands, and flatten the ball into a 1/2" thickness, rounding the edges.
Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface (you can place between sheets of wax or parchment paper, if that is easier), and roll into a 10" circle (roll with your wrists doing the work, not your shoulders.
I saw that on a Bobby Flay - Pie Throwdown episode).
Gently transfer to a 9" pie plate.
Gently press the pastry down into the plate, being sure not to stretch or tear the dough.
If it does tear a little, just take some off the edge, and "patch" it.
Create a decorative edge around the top, and cut any extra crust off of the edge.
Repeat for a second single-crust pie, or fill the bottom crust and top with the second half of this recipe for a double-crust pie.
Blind bake the crusts or fill and bake as directed in your recipe.



In blender grind almonds and flax seeds until fine.
Add salt.
Add water 2 cups first and blend until it is fluffy.
If it is too sticky add more water.
Spread on paraflexx and dehydrate for 12-20 hours.
Flip after 3-4 hours.
Continue dehydrating until crisp.
Stores well for 2 weeks-1 month.



Wash, peel, coarsly chop carrots.
Coarsly chop onion.
Saute onion in oil.
When onion is translucent, add carrots, broth, and garlic.
Bring to a boil.
Turn heat to simmer, and cook until carrots are soft enough to puree.
Add peanut butter, then either transfer soup to blender or use stick blender to puree everything together.
Season with Siracha, salt and pepper, mint, basil, maple syrup, or other seasonings to taste.



Transfer the orange juice to a blender.
Add the milk, vanilla, both sugars and 1 cup ice and blend until smooth and frothy.
Divide among 4 chilled glasses.



Add asparagus to frypan and cook til slightly golden.
add bacon, pistachios and balsamic vinegar.
cook until vinegar has reduced.
serve with , poppy seeds sprinkled on top with salt and freshly ground pepper.



Blend the sugar, vinegar and water.
Toss with the salad greens and keep in a cool place (up to several hours).
Just before serving, drain off the liquid, add it to the oil AND WHATEVER SEASONINGS YOU LIKE and toss again with your greens.



Place the quarter-cup of tepid water in a small bowl and sprinkle in the yeast.
When it dissolves, add the third of a cup of water.
Beat in the flour until the very soft dough is smooth and elastic.
Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
The sourdough will remain useable for about five days.
To keep the sourdough alive, remove and use or discard a half-cup of it.
Beat in a third of a cup of water and a half-cup of flour.
Cover tightly and refrigerate.



Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Grease a 10x15-inch baking sheet.
Combine corn cereal, rice cereal, pretzels, and peanuts in a large bowl.
Heat peanut butter, butter, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and garlic powder in a saucepan over high heat until peanut butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
Pour mixture over cereal mixture and toss to evenly coat.
Spread cereal mixture over prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until cereal mixture is dry, about 1 hour.

Brush each biscuit with a small amount of water on a pastry brush, and sprinkle with brown sugar.
Place tray in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack, though I think these taste best when still warm!



Combine figs, sugar, whiskey, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, and salt in a small saucepan; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until liquid reduces by half, about 30 minutes.
Cool before serving.



Puree all ingredients in a blender.



Use pastry blender or two butter knives to chop up shortening in flour and salt to pea-sized lumps.
Stir in water, a few tbsp at a time, stirring with butter knife.
(Do not stir in ice cubes.)
Don't mash.
When mixture starts to form big clumps you've added enough water.
You won't use a full cup of water, more like 1/2 cup, but keep enough water on hand just in case.
The key is to keep everything chilled until you get it into the oven.
Touching it too much will warm it up.
Be paranoid.
The other secret is not to blend it too much, keep it loosely binding until you roll it.
If the shortening lumps are too small it won't be as flaky.
Place a sheet of plastic wrap on counter.
Sprinkle it with flour.
Pick up half of pastry mix, form into ball and place on the centre of sheet, being careful to neither mash it or handle it much.
Cover with second sheet of plastic wrap.
Roll from centre out to 1/2 centimeter (1/4 inch) thickness.
Remove top sheet of plastic.
Place pie plate upside-down on top of pastry, place hand under plastic, flip, gently press into pan, remove plastic.
Trim edges with knife.
(Flute edges - optional.
).
Chill in fridge until ready to add filling and bake.
May be frozen.
Makes two layers of crust; top/bottom or two bottom crusts.
Tip - for a rolling pin use a wine bottle or other glass bottle filled with water and kept in the fridge.



bring cooked rice, 2 cups water, and salt to boil, then reduce to simmer for 25 minutes.
add honey while the rice/water is still hot.
blend above mixture on high until it's smooth.
add vanilla, oil and 2 cups of water/ice and blend again.
pour this mixture through a fine sieve or cheese cloth to remove rice particles.
place mixture into a container with 2 more cups of water/ice.
shake well for each use.



Preheat the oven to 400 if baking.
Grease a baking sheet or a skillet.
Mix the dry ingredients.
Add the yogurt.
Add enough water to make a batter.
Pour onto the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
OR fry in the frying pan, turning once the first side is golden brown.



Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.
If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 2 minutes.
If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for 2 minutes, until well blended.
If the spoon gets too doughy, dip it in a bowl of warm water.
The dough should be very soft, sticky, coarse, and shaggy, but still doughlike.
Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl.
Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
To stretch and fold the dough in the bowl, with wet or oiled hands or a wet bowl scraper, reach under the front end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough.
Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.
The dough should be significantly firmer, though still very soft and fragile.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Repeat this stretch and fold process three more times, completing all repetitions within 40 to 45 minutes.
The dough will be a little firmer than when first mixed and the shaggy texture will have smoothed out somewhat, but it will still spread out to fill the bowl.
After the final stretch and fold, return the dough to the lightly oiled bowl, and immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days.
The dough will rise to about double, and possibly triple, its original size within 4 to 12 hours in the refrigerator.
(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)
Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before you plan to bake.
Rub the work surface with a few drops of olive or vegetable oil, then use a wet bowl scraper or wet hands to transfer the dough to the work surface.
Divide the dough in half (about 21 oz or 595 g each) for two large loaves; into 4 to 6 pieces for smaller loaves; or into 18 to 24 pieces for rolls.
Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat, then mist it lightly with spray oil or dust it with flour, semolina, or cornmeal.
(If using a banneton or proofing mold, mist it with spray oil, then dust it with flour.)
Have a small bowl of bread flour standing by.
With floured hands, gently pat the dough pieces into rectangles, then stretch it into torpedos (see page 21), boules (see page 20), or loaves (see page 23), or shape it into rolls (see page 25).
With floured hands, gently lift the dough and place it seam side down on the prepared pan (or seam side up in the proofing mold).
If air bubbles form, pinch the surface to pop them.
Mist the surface of the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let the shaped dough sit, covered, at room temperature for 60 minutes.
Then, remove the covering and let the dough proof for an additional 60 minutes.
The dough will spread slightly and the skin will begin to dry out a bit.
About 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C) or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30).
Just before baking, score the dough with a sharp serrated knife or razor blade.
The dough will have spread somewhat but should still have its basic shape, and the shape should spring back in the oven.
(If using a banneton or proofing mold, remove the dough from the basket at this stage.)
Transfer the dough to the oven, pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C), or 425F (218C) for a convection oven.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is a rich golden brown and the internal temperature is 200F to 205F (93C to 94C).
For a crisper crust, turn off the oven and leave the bread in for another 5 to 10 minutes before removing (rolls will take less time).
Cool the bread on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

To toast the nuts, place them on a baking sheet and set them aside for a moment.
Then start to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the nuts in the preheated oven and bake for 7-10 minutes.
At the 7 minute mark, check them and make sure they still need more time.
Keep an eye on them at this point because they can burn quickly.
Once the nuts are toasted, remove them from the oven and place them in the bottom of a greased 9x9 pan.
I used a lot of PAM baking spray to grease my pan.
In a heavy bottomed sauce pan, add your butter, sugar and water and turn on high to bring to a rapid boil.
Stir with a wooden spoon if needed.
You will continue to boil on high until the mixture turns into an amber color and starts to JUST smoke.
At that point, remove it from the heat immediately and pour it over the nuts.
See the related blog link for a picture of the color when done.
Once it starts to turn darker, it goes very quickly so be ready to move.
Let this sit for about 10 minutes before you add the chocolate chips to the top.
Then add the chocolate chips.
Let the chocolate sit on top for about 5 minutes until you can tell that it is soft.
Then take a spatula and spread the chocolate over the top.
You will now have to let this sit for a few hours to harden.
After about 3 hours, I got sick of waiting and threw it in the fridge to make the chocolate set.
It worked like a charm.

This is called Pepperoni Loaf because when you roll the dough, you roll it as one whole piece instead of several little pieces.
Pour warm water into a bowl.
The water should be about 85 to 115F Test it with your hand.
It should feel very warm, but comfortable.
Add the honey and salt.

Add the yeast and mix.
Let this mixture sit for about 5 minutes.
Add 1 cup of flour and the olive oil and mix until well blended.
Add the rest of the flour (and any other additions) and mix well.
The dough should turn into a ball.
If the dough does not ball up because it's too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it does.
If your mixture is more like a batter, add flour one tablespoon at a time.
Adding water or flour as needed to get the right consistency will assure you always get a perfect dough.
Just remember to do it in small amounts.
Once the dough is balled up, place the ball on a floured board and knead for about a minute.
This builds the gluten which helps the dough to rise and become fluffy when cooked.
Place the dough in a plastic grocery bag or a covered bowl and store in a warm, dry area to rise.

Add powdered sugar and soymilk, then beat on medium for about a minute, or until it's a good consistency for spreading.
Stir in extracts and frost away!
ALSO suggested:
The original recipe is for chocolate frosting - add 2/3 cup cocoa powder before adding sugar in either form of preparation, and add 1 1/2 tsp almond extract with the vanilla.
This would also be lovely with a little citrus zest - add orange or lemon zest with the extracts.

About 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle, check the dough and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water; the finished dough should be soft and supple.
Place a pizza stone on a rack in the bottom of your oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.
Turn the dough onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide it into 8 pieces; set aside on a separate plate and cover with a towel.
Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of the white whole wheat flour, place one of your 8 balls of dough on the floured surface, and sprinkle the top of the ball with a little bit of flour too.
Roll it out into a 6-inch circle and set it aside to rest for 15 minutes.
Repeat for the remaining balls of dough.
Once 15 minutes have passed (probably about the time you finish rolling out all the dough), place the first circle you rolled out on the hot pizza stone in the hot oven; you should not need to grease the stone-- just be sure you've got some loose flour grains on the bottom of the dough (kind of like using corn meal when you bake a pizza).
Bake the pita for 5 minutes; it should puff up like a balloon and have golden brown spots; If it hasn't puffed up, wait a minute or so longer; If it still hasn't puffed, your oven isn't hot enough; raise the heat for the next batch.
Remove the pita from the oven, wrap it in a clean damp dish towel (this keeps them soft) for a couple of minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely; Repeat with the remaining dough, making sure that the oven temperature returns to 500 degrees F before placing a new circle on the stone.
Store cooled pitas in an airtight container or plastic bag; if freezing, wrap pitas individually in foil and then place multiple foil packs in a freezer bag; You can reheat in the foil in your oven, or remove the foil and place frozen pita in your toaster.

Preheat oven to 350.
First, start your rice.
Brown rice can take up to 45 minutes to cook sometimes (although I like the Uncle Ben's 10-minute brown rice).
Time it accordingly so that the rice is finished by the time the main dish is finished.
Pour the salsa into the bottom of a 13" x 9" glass baking dish.
You can add extra if you want salsa leftover to mix into the rice.
Fillet the chicken breasts.
Lay them on top of the salsa.

Then, mix in the prepared rice into the dish with the leftover salsa and beans, and serve alongside the chicken.
Enjoy!



Over a direct source of heat warm 1 gallon of milk to 180 degrees F., stirring often to keep it from scorching.
Maintain this temperature for several minutes.
Slowly add vinegar until the curds separate from the whey.
Usually 1/4 cup of vinegar will precipitate 1 gallon of milk.
Pour the curds and whey into a cheesecloth-lined colander.
Tie the four corners of the cheesecloth into a knot and hang to drain for several hours or until the bag of curds stops dripping.
Take the mass of curds out of the cheesecloth.
It will be a solid bag of curd.
It may be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator until needed.
It will keep up to 1 week.



Slice potatoes thin (about 3/8 inch thick) I use my food processor for this.
Place a thin layer of sliced potatoes in a 12 x 7 1/2 x 2 inch baking dish.
Put small dots of butter on top of potatoes followed by the dill and salt.
Cover with aluminium foil and bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
After 15 minutes, stir potaotes to enhance flavor.



Combine the vinegar, lemon juice, and honey in a blender.
With the motor running, gradually add the oil.
Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper, adding more to taste if needed.



Process all ingredients in a food processor or blender.
Pour over the meat you are going to marinate.
Fish should marinate no more than a half hour, but poultry and red meat can marinate for up to 4 hours (or overnight) in the refrigerator.



Prepare grill using charcoal and hickory wood chips or preheat gas grill to low.
Combine first four ingredients (sugar - pepper) in a bowl and rub all over ribs.

Make sure to break up the rice malt if it's a solid.
I usually break it up with my hands as-is without opening the package.
Turn the rice cooker onto the warming setting, and add in the rice malt.
If you use refrigerated rice malt or if the pot is cold, the temperature will drop immediately, so warm it up first.
Add 150F/70C water, and mix well.
It will immediately drop to 120F/50C, so close the lid and let it warm up for a bit, until it reaches above 60c.
Making sure the temperature doesn't drop too much, stir it little by little while checking the temperature.
It will take about 3-4 hours for the rice malt to sweeten.
It depends on the rice cooker, but all I do is turn on the warm switch twice.
Once it drops below 120F/50C, I heat it up for another 20-30 minutes and then turn it off again.
Rice malt ferments at about 130F (110-140F) / 55C(45-60C).
Keep turning the warming switch on and off to prevent cooling down.
It will stop fermenting once it reaches above 160F/70C.
It gets pretty hot even with the warm function, so don't cover it with a lid for too long.
If it's a rice cooker where you can set the temperature, it might be suitable to choose the lowest heat setting.
Or use a yogurt maker, which sets at 130F/55C.
If you are making it in a thermos, use a 500 ml bottle.
Pour hot water to warm it up before pouring the mixture in and make sure the heat doesn't drop when you change the water.
Just like in Step 3, heat to 140F/60C, and mix well.
Transfer to a bottle, let sit for about 8-12 hours, and you are done!
If the temperature drops too far, then it won't be very sweet.
But don't give up!
If you transfer it to a pot and warm it over low heat, it'll become sweet again in a blink of an eye .
Once it's done, dilute with water to make amazake (sweet sake).
You can use it just like jam or yogurt, or use it to make healthy sweets .
Freeze it in silicone cups or in ziplock bags, and make frozen treats .
The dense rice malt will not freeze solid, so it's convenient!
Mix with fruit, yogurt, or tofu, or make sherbet or ice cream.
Add soy milk or regular milk and make a shake.
It's delicious enough without adding any sugar.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cream together butter and sugar; add vanilla, flour, and potato chips.
Drop by 1/2 tsp.

Return parsnips to skillet.
Cook parsnips over low heat, stirring, until heated through and coated with glaze, Stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.



In the carafe of a blender, combine all ingredients.
Blend for 10 seconds, or until smooth.
Pour the mixture into a clean, quart-sized glass jar.
Barely screw on the lidgasses need to be able to escape.
Skip this step and therell be broken glass to pick up later.
Stash the jar in a warm (80 to 85F would be nice) place for 24 hours.
Use right away or feed it another cup of warm water mixed with a cup of flour and stash it in the refrigerator.
Every time you use a cup of culture, feed the starter a cup of water and flour.



Blend all.
Serve over crushed ice.



Place all ingredients in a blender and pulse blend until smooth.



Zest the orange and mix all ingredients in a mixing bowl.
Mix on high speed for one minute scraping the bowl once or twice.

Pop into the chill chest for 16-24 hours to let it rise.
After the dough has risen, remove for the refrigerator and divide in half.
Roll out the fill with your favorite stuffings.
Cook at 500 degrees on a stone (works best) or a 9 x 13-inch pan for 7 minutes or until golden brown.



COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS in a deep-sided metal baking pan.
Freeze, uncovered, until mixture is nearly set, at least 4 hours, whisking mixture every hour.
Remove mixture from freezer and scrape surface with the tines of a fork until it is the texture of shaved ice.
(Mixture can be frozen overnight without whisking; remove from freezer in the morning, and let sit at room temperature about 10 minutes to allow it to slightly soften before scraping with a fork as instructed.)



Set out 6 parfait glasses.
Divide the strawberry yogurt among them, keep sides of glasses as clean as possible.
Then divide 2 cups of the vanilla yogurt between the glasses by spooning the yogurt on top of the strawberry layer.

Place berries in a food processor; process them into chunky puree.
Transfer puree to a small saucepan over low heat.
Heat until warm.
Stir in lemon juice and maple syrup.



Mix oats with water in a 2-quart glass microwaveable dish.
(The size of the bowl is important because it needs to be large enough to allow the oats to bubble without spilling over.
).
COVER and place the dish in the microwave oven on high for 5 minutes.
Stir.
Cook UNCOVERED for another 5 minutes.



Turn on stove, to a "very low heat" (gas works best).
(Too high a heat, will make butter brown, and marshmallows toast, or candy, instead of melt Smooth).
spray pot with cooking spray (lightly).
add butter and melt on "very Low heat" stiring occasionally.
add marshmalolows: melt stiring often (as to "not" candy or burn them) (marshmallows are done when they are smooth no lumps and still hold their origional color, If they start to go transparent, they have cooked too long!
).
add Rice Krispies : stir until evenly coated.
pour into a (lightly sprayed) pan or mold of your choice.
(I use two bread pans, about 14x4)
press firmly into mold!
remove from mold, and cool completely --.
cut serve and enjoy!
(I cut each pan into 8 pieces.
{16 total}).



First sift together the cocoa powder and powdered sugar into a medium sized bowl, then set aside.
Melt together the chocolate and heavy cream in the top of a double broiler (with simmering water in the bottom).
Once the chocolate is melted, remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the vanilla.
Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (or at least one hour).
Once cooled, scoop and shape the chocolate mixture into one inch balls (I used a melon baller to make them even.)
Roll them in the cocoa and powdered sugar mixture until coated and serve!
Enjoy!



Preheat oven to 350 F.
Mix all the ingredients together.
Pour into 9 inch non-stick pan (or into premade crust if desired).
Bake until set, about 60 minutes (check with fork at 45 minutes -- ).



Mix wafer crumbs with 1 cup of the confectioners sugar, pecans and cocoa and cherries.
Stir in rum and corn syrup.
Shape into 1-inch balls.
Roll balls on remaining sugar.
Store in tightly covered container.
Refrigerate.



With a pastry brush or paper towel, spread the bottom and side of a 1 1/2 quart loaf pan or mold with 1 tablespoon of soft butter and sprinkle the mold with 2 tablespoons of dry bread crumbs.
Make sure the crumbs are evenly distributed and tap out any excess.
Cut the fish into small pieces and place a few pieces at a time in a blender, along with a couple of tablespoons of the combined creams to facilitate pur?eing.
Blend at high speed, turning the machine off after the first few seconds to scrape down the sides of the jar with a spatula.
Continue to blend, one batch at a time, until all of the fish is a smooth puree.
As you proceed, use as much of the cream as you need to form this smooth puree.
Place the pureed fish in a large mixing bowl, beat in 2 teaspoons of salt and the 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch and slowly add any of the cream that was not used in the blender, beating vigorously until the mixture is very light and fluffy.
Pour into the prepared mold and bang sharply on the counter to settle the pudding and eliminate any air pockets.
Smooth the top with a spatula.
Preheat oven to 350F (180C).
Butter a sheet of tin foil and seal it tightly around the top of the mold.
Place the mold in a baking pan and pour into the pan enough boiling water to come 3/4 of the way up the sides of the mold.
Set the pan in the middle of the oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, regulating the heat if necessary so that the water simmers but does not boil; if it boils, the pudding will have holes.
When the top of the pudding is firm to the touch and a toothpick or skewer in the middle comes out dry and clean, the pudding is done.
Remove the mold from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.
Pour off all excess liquid in mold, run a sharp knife around the inside, place a heated platter on top and holding the mold and plate together, quickly invert the two to remove the pudding from the mold.
Clear the place of any liquid with paper towels and serve the fiskepudding while still hot.



Line a cookie sheet with foil and spray it with non-stick cooking spray.
Place almonds in a single layer on cookie sheet.
Cook butter, sugar, water, vanilla and salt in a heavy saucepan over high heat, stirring mixture constantly, 15-18 minutes or until a candy thermometer registers 310F.
Remove from heat and immediately pour over almonds (do not scrape the pan).
Sprinkle immediately with chocolate morsels and spread evenly to 1/2 inch from sides.
Sprinkle with ground walnuts.
Let stand until firm.
Break into small pieces and store in an airtight container.
(The toffee mixture will not coat the entire baking sheet).



In a 3-quart saucepan combine both sugars and the milk and bring to a boil over medium heat, while stirring constantly.
Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking mixture, without stirring, until it reaches the soft-ball stage, 236 degrees F. Remove saucepan from the heat and add the butter and vanilla, but do not stir.
Let the mixture cool without stirring until it reaches 110 degrees F, about 20 minutes.
While the mixture is cooling, butter an 8-inch-square pan.
Set aside.
Once the mixture has cooled, beat with a wooden spoon until the butter is fully incorporated and mixture starts to thicken.
Quickly pour the mixture into the pan before it becomes too solid.
Let cool completely before cutting into 1 inch squares.
Store leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator.



Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Sift the flour, sugar and salt together.
Add the butter and use your hands or a pastry cutter to combine until the mixture is crumbly.
Work into a ball and knead briefly.
Pat into a 1/4-inch sheet on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Cut the dough into 2-inch diamonds.
Bake for 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven.
Immediately recut the cookies.
Separate carefully and cool on a rack.
Cookies can be frozen in an airtight container, with wax paper between each layer for up to 6 months.
Defrost 30 minutes before serving.



Bring the milk up to 190 degrees in a non-aluminum pot and then hold the temp at 190, stirring occasionally.
(I do this in a crock pot to avoid scorching by heating it slowly -- I also use a thermometer).
After the milk has sat at 190 for 10 minutes, I start adding the vinegar.
This is something you kind of have to do by sight.
The milk will start to curdle instantly.
Continue adding the vinegar a tablespoon at a time until you can see definite separation of the milk curd and the whey (*it'll look like greenish colored egg drop soup.
*).
Strain the whey away from the cheese by pouring it into a collander lined with cheesemaker's cheesecloth, muslin or a potato sack towel.
The cheese will look white a rubbery.
Bring up the edges of the towel and tie together.
Twist the towel from the top down to the cheese until the cheese is in a ball and the whey is running off of it.
Hang the towel from the kitchen sink or a hook over the kitchen sink.
Allow the cheese to hang from your kitchen sink draining for about 3 hours (I've left it overnight and it's been fine).
About every half hour for the first two hours, give the cheese a good wringing by twisting the towel from the top down to help it form a good compact ball.
This cheese keeps in the fridge for several days or in the freezer indefinitely.



Melt butter w honey.

Wash the spring ginger roots, and slice very very thinly without peeling (I used a vegetable peeler to slice it thinly).
The ginger roots are not peeled, but do cut off any browned or discolored bits.
Don't cut the red shoot ends off.
They will turn the ginger a pretty pink color.
Sprinkle the sliced ginger with a little salt (not listed), and mix up quickly.

Danger!
This is the dry-burn technique.
I don't add water to the sugar before putting it on the heat, as some chefs do.
Caramelizing sugar dry means it goes faster, but you have to watch it more closely and be ready with your cream.
Here is an overview of what you are going to do:.
Stand over the pan of sugar with a heatproof spatula ready, but do not touch the sugar until there is a full layer of melted and browning liquid sugar on the bottom with a smaller layer of unmelted white sugar on the top.
When the edges of the melted sugar begin to darken, use the spatula to bring them into the center to help melt the unmelted sugar.
Continue stirring and pushing the sugar around until it is all melted and evenly amber in color--like an old penny.
When little bubbles begin to explode with dark smoke, give the sugar another moment and then remove from the heat.
Immediately but slowly pour about 1/4 cup of the cream and corn syrup mixture into the burning-hot sugar.
Be careful!
It will pop and spit!
Stir until it is incorporated, then add a bit more cream and stir, then continue until it is all inches.
Mix about 2 tablespoons of the milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl to make a smooth slurry.
Whisk the cream cheese and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.
Mix the cream with the corn syrup in a measuring cup with a spout.
Fill a large bowl with ice and water.
Heat the sugar in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat until it is melted and golden amber in color (see note above).
Remove from the heat and, stirring constantly, slowly add a bit of the cream and corn syrup mixture to the caramel: It will fizzle, pop, and spurt.
Stir until well combined, then add a little more and stir.
Keep adding the cream a little at a time until all of it is incorporated.
Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the milk.
Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 4 minutes.
Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry.
Bring back to a boil over medium-high and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.
Remove from the heat.
If any caramel flecks remain, pour the mixture through a sieve.
Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the cream cheese until smooth.
Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziploc freezer bag and submerge the sealed bag in the ice bath.
Let stand, adding more ice as necessary, until cold, about 30 minutes.
Pour into frozen canister and spin until thick and creamy.
Pack the ice cream into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid.
Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours.



In a small pan over very low heat, melt chocolate and butter, stirring constantly.
Place mixture in refrigerator for 2030 minutes to chill.
Remove from refrigerator and whip with a hand blender until thick and fluffy.

Note: To avoid the potential of burned raisins on the bottom of the flutes, bake each pan separately, placing it in the upper third of the oven.
Or bake pans at the same time, but for 30 minutes only, even if the flutes havent yet begun to brown.



Note that this recipe's cooking method is for a gas stove.
You might have to monkey with the heat a bit on an electric one.
Add all ingredients to the Whirley pop, and pop, using, on average, a medium heat: alternate between a lower flame and a high one.
This is in order to send the heat to the outside edges, which is where the popper sends the popcorn!
Be sure to remove from the heat quickly when the popping slows.
Empty immediately into a big bowl, and stir around with a big spoon and/or your hands to break apart the kernals.
(Careful - it's hot!
).
For an easier cleanup, put some water and a squirt of soap immediately into the popper to soak.
After it has cooled thoroughly, keep in an air-tight container to prevent sogginess.
Whirley Pop Notes:.
I actually purchased mine because, try as I might, I just couldnt make great Kettle Corn in a pot on top of the stove.
I tried a number of recipes.
They all came out tough, and never fully popped, and the sugar always burned.
And I am a pretty patient cook!
To make matters worse, the cleanup of burnt sugar on my stainless pots was a significant chore!
So, I bought a Whirley-pop.
With all the great reviews on-line, I knew I would come to love it.
I was right!
It makes great popcorn, all kinds!
Bonus is that you can use less oil than cooking in a pot, like only 2 teaspoons per 1/2 cup batch.
So, this recipe is for a Whirley Pop, as I haven't personally had any success in a regular pot.
If you don't have one yet, and you make popcorn a lot, I highly recommend one!
Although they are mostly a "single-use" item, they are only about $23.
And, personally, I recommend this Kettle Corn recipe over the one in the book.

To ensure that the shallot slices crisp up, you must first remove some excess moisture.
Using your fingers, separate the slices into individual layers, depositing them on a paper towel.
Gather up the paper towel and gently blot away the moisture.
Set near the stove.
In a 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat.
Add the shallot and fry gently, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.
After 5 to 6 minutes, when the shallot is fragrant and lightly golden, watch the progress closely, moving the shallot slices frequently by stirring them or swirling the pan.
During frying, the shallot will soften into a mass and then stiffen as it caramelizes and crisps.
When most of the slices are a rich golden brown, remove the pan from the heat.
The total cooking time should be about 10 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallot slices to a paper towellined plate, spreading them out in a single layer.
Discard the fragrant oil or reserve it for other uses.
When the shallot slices have cooled, crisped, and darkened slightly, transfer them to a small bowl or plate.
Left uncovered at room temperature, they will retain their crispiness for a good 8 hours.
Even if they no longer rustle when you shake them, they are still tasty.

You will have to cook, flip, and turn the onions for the next 50 minutes or so.
Chang gave us guidelines to be able to tell what were looking for.
3.
For the next 15 minutes, the onions at the bottom will slowly cook and the weight from the top will help this to happen.
Dont press down on the onions with a spatula.
Turn the whole pile every 3-4 minutes.
Remember to take advantage of the weight from the onions above.
4.
After the onions have significantly reduced and become soft, time to turn the heat to medium-low.
At this stage, you will have to turn the pile every 10 minutes to prevent sticking to the pan and being burnt.

1.
Rinse and drain the raspberries.
Place in a large bowl.
2.
Sprinkle the sugar over the raspberries and toss together.
Cover tightly and let berries macerate for 4 hours or overnight.
3.
Line a colander or sieve with a few layers of cheesecloth and place over another bowl.
Pour the berry mixture into the colander and strain out the solids.
Gently press the fruit mixture to squeeze out as much juice as possible.
4.
Mix the vinegar into the juice.
Pour into a glass bottle or jar, seal it and store in the fridge.
This mixture should keep for several months in the fridge.
You can save the fruit pulp and add it to yogurt or muffins.
Shrubs are also called drinking vinegar.
Back in the day, there were no refrigerators to help preserve fresh fruit for longer than a day or two.
Adding the sugar draws out the fruit juices via osmosis.
Traditionally, the mixture would be left to ferment into alcohol, then vinegar.
Adding vinegar to the fruit syrup is a much quicker and easier way to produce the same thing.
Store the shrub in the fridge indefinitely.
After a few weeks, youll find that the flavour of the shrub changes, as the remaining sugar ferments with natural yeasts and turns into alcohol, which in turn ferments into vinegar.
Since the advent of refrigeration, shrubs have all but disappeared.

If you want to bake the biscuits, bake 10-12 minutes at 450.
For skillet biscuits:.
Cook the biscuits on a lightly greased hot skillet/griddle about 1 inch apart.
Use your best judgement as to the heat - I generally use a more moderate flame and brown biscuits 3 to 4 minutes each side, though the original recipe says to brown them for 5-7 minutes each side over high heat.
As mentioned above - the biscuits will not be light and fluffy like with baked biscuits - so don't wait for them to rise and be puffy.
They will be more dense.
The best approach is to keep an eye on them and turn them when they are browned and dry-looking on one side before turning them over.

Set aside to cool, then puree in a blender or food processor.
Put the remaining ingredients for the pastry in a blender or food processor with 30 ml (2 tbsp) water and mix to a dough.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface, then roll out to an oblong about 40 x 12 cm (16 x 5 inches).
Spread the fig puree down the centre of the dough rectangle and carefully fold in the sides so that they overlap over the filling.
Trim the ends of the roll and cut into 3 cm (1 1/4 inch) wide slices.
Turn the rolls over and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Mark the top of each roll with a wet fork and bake for 25-30 minutes, until lightly browned.
Cool on a rack.



Preheat oven to 400.
Mix flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl.
Cut butter into small cubes and blend with a pastry blender until it resembles oatmeal (or small peas, if you don't like oatmeal).
Add the orange zest and strawberries.
Then slowly and gradually add the cream while mixing with a fork.
As soon as the flour starts to come together into a dough, remove from the bowl and form into a ball.
Place on a lightly floured surface and knead gently four or five times.
Then shape with your hands (or a rolling pin) into an 8x10" rectangle.
Cut the rectangle lengthwise into two 4x10" rectangles.
Cut each of those into 6 or 7 triangles and place on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
Serve warm with softened butter, jam, creme fraiche or just as they are!



Preheat the oven to 300 degrees; have ready an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, cream the butter until fluffy and pale yellow.
Add the powdered sugar and 1/4 cup granulated sugar and continue beating until the mixture is no longer gritty when rubbed between your finger and thumb.

Using floured fingertips, press the dough evenly into the pan.
Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake the shortbread until the edges are golden, about 1 hour.
Remove the pan from the oven and immediately use a thin sharp knife to cut the shortbread into strips 3 inches by 1 inch.
Use a toothpick or the tines of a fork to decorate the shortbread with a pattern of dots.
Let the strips cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes before transferring them to the rack to cool completely.



Boil sausage till done.
Combine all remaining ingredients; bring to a boil and simmer 2-3 min.
(Double the sauce recipe if your Kielbasa is large.)
When sausage is done, cold slightly and slice into bite-size pcs.
Combine sausage and sauce; cover and chill for at least 24 hrs.
Heat and serve.



In a large bowl, combine 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour with the cake flour, salt, and sugar.
With a pastry blender, cut in the butter pieces (1 stick) until the mixture resembles coarse meal, with a few larger clumps remaining.
Make a well in the center, and pour in 1 cup cold water and the vinegar, gradually drawing the flour mixture over the water, gathering and combining until mixture comes together to form a dough.
If the dough is too dry, add more cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Knead gently in the bowl, and form dough into a rough ball.
Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 40 minutes or up to 2 hours.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour on a sheet of parchment.
Lay remaining 4 sticks of butter on top, side by side; sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons flour.
Top with more parchment; pound butter with a rolling pin until its about 1/2 inch thick.
Remove top paper, fold butter in half, replace paper; pound butter until its 1/2 inch thick.
Repeat two or three more times until it is pliable.
Using a bench scraper, shape butter into a 6-inch square; wrap in plastic, and refrigerate until chilled, about 10 minutes.
Lightly dust work surface with flour.
Roll out dough to a 9-inch round; place butter package in center.
Using a paring knife or bench scraper, lightly score dough to outline butter square.
Remove butter; set aside.
Starting from each side of marked square, gently roll out dough to form four flaps, each 4 to 5 inches long; do not touch square.
Return butter to center square; fold flaps over butter.
Press with your hands to seal.
With the rolling pin, gently pound the dough all over in regular intervals until it is about 1 inch thick; this will soften the dough, making it easier to roll.
Working in only one direction (lengthwise), gently roll out the dough to a 20-by-9-inch rectangle, squaring corners with the side of the rolling pin or your hands as you go.
Using a dry pastry brush, sweep off excess flour.
With a short side facing you, fold the rectangle in thirds like a business letter.
Turn the dough a quarter-turn clockwise, so the flap opening faces right, like a book.
(This completes the first turn.)
Roll out the dough again to a 20-by-9-inch rectangle, rolling in the same lengthwise direction; fold dough again into thirds.
(This completes the second turn.)
Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour.
Repeat the rolling, turning, and chilling process for a total of six turns; always start each turn with the opening of the dough to the right.
(If at any time, the dough becomes too soft to work with, return it to the refrigerator until firm.)
Wrap dough in plastic; refrigerate 3 to 4 hours before using the dough.
A cold stick of butter that has been cut into small pieces is added to a bowl of all-purpose and cake flours, sugar, and salt.
A pastry blender is used to cut the butter pieces into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse meal, with some larger clumps remaining (as shown on spoon).
After a well is made in the center of the mixture, a combination of cold water and vinegar is poured into the well and gradually stirred in to combine.
Once a dough has formed, it is shaped into a rough ball; afterward, it is wrapped in plastic and refrigerated until well chilled.
To form the butter package, 4 sticks of cold butter are placed side by side on a floured work surface, then sprinkled with more flour.
A piece of parchment paper is placed over the butter, and a rolling pin is used to pound the butter until it is about 1/2 inch thick.
The paper is removed, and the butter is folded in half, and then covered and pounded once again.
This process is repeated two or three more times until the butter is pliable.
The butter package is shaped into a 6-inch square and refrigerated until chilled.
Meanwhile, the dough is rolled out to a 9-inch round (not pictured); the chilled butter is placed in the center, and its edges are lightly outlined with a knife or bench scraper.
The butter is removed, and the dough is rolled out away from these marks to form four flaps, leaving the square in the center untouched.
The butter package is returned to the square; the flaps are folded over to enclose the butter and pressed down to seal.
With a rolling pin, the dough is pounded at regular intervals until it is about 1 inch thick.
The dough is gently rolled out on a piece of parchment into a 20-by-9-inch rectangle, keeping the corners square; a dry pastry brush is used to remove excess flour.
The rectangle is folded into thirds like a business letter.
The folded dough is turned one-quarter turn clockwise, so that the open edge faces right.
The process of rolling and folding is repeated as above.
Af ter the second turn, the dough is marked with an indentation before chilling.
The dough is refrigerated for at least 1 hour, before the process is repeated twice more, for a total of six turns (see here).

The punto, the exact moment when the candy is ready varies not only between different types of candy but also with relation to personal preference.
It is one of the most important aspects of the candy making process because it defines the texture.
Throughout my travels, whenever I asked someone when theyd know their creation was ready, they always responded when it reaches the punto.
I didnt find one person in Mexico who relied on thermometers or cared to have one.

I suggest adding everything but the cream shake it them pour and stir in the cream.
I have accidentally made whipped cream before :).
Note on sweetener; I typically use truvia but you can use whatever you are using a very small amount so the carbs in the real sugar are negligible.
You can drink this right away but a good 24 hours in the fridge definitely improves the flavor and consistency.
It lasts about a week and a half when I make a liter of it.



Rinse and drain rice in cold water.
Place in a saucepan with water, coconut milk, and salt.
Place the pot over high heat and, bring the liquid to a boil.

Mix the butter, maple syrup and sea salt in a large bowl with a fork.
If your butter is still cold, just work the fork into it more.
Add 1/4 of the oat flour and stir and mash.
Add the rest slowly while stirring and mashing (this will help the butter even out easily).
Next, add the almond meal and stir and mash.
Use your hand to ensure that butter is worked into the dough evenly.
Press the dough in to the prepared pie dish.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes if you are going to bake a pie, or 15 minutes if you are going to fill the crust with a no-bake filling.
Let cool completely before filling the pie.

Be careful not to overheat.
Beat the butter and sugars, running your beater up and down to add in air until the mixture is fluffy.
Spoon the oats and pistachio into the mix, followed by flour and baking soda.
(I prefer not to use mixers when adding in flour).
Chill the mixture for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
This helps to hold the cookie dough together and allow the oats to soak up the butter and coconut oil.
I sometimes skip this step because Im impatient, so its ok if you do, too.
Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (355 degrees F).
Using your hands, scoop up dough and press onto a greased pan or baking sheet.
I find that smaller cookies hold better (about 2-inch diameter); if you make larger ones, they may turn out crumbly.
I usually squeeze the cookie dough together before placing on the baking tray because I feel like it holds together better.
Bake for 20 minutes or until slightly browned.
Notes: 1.
You may use gluten-free flour in place of all-purpose flour for a vegan option.
2.
You may replace the 50 grams of butter with an additional 50ml of coconut oil.
3.
If you do have lots of crumbs, dont fear because they make the perfect topping for oatmeal!

Initial Cleaning (before first use): remove the factory coating - to do this, fill the pan 1/2 to 2/3 full with water.
Boil 5-7 minute Pour the water out of the pan.
Immediately scrub with hot soapy water and harsh scouring pad.
Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care.
Scrub vigorously both inside and out, then rinse and wipe dry.
Immediately season your pan.
Initial Seasoning: rub 2 tbsp cooking oil over the entire surface of the pan.
Place over medium heat for about 10 minute Using a paper towel, distribute the oil over the inside of the pan while it is heating.
Tilt the pan over the burner so that the sides of the pan heat as well as the bottom.
Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care.
Remove the pan from the heat and cool.
Repeat 3-4 times.
Your pan is now seasoned and ready to use.
Basic Care: wash with hot water only (no soap) and immediately dry thoroughly.
Soaps or detergents will remove the seasoning.
Remove burned food with a scouring pad and hot water.
Apply a light film of cooking oil before storing to prevent rusting.
If you use soap to clean your pan, simply follow the initial seasoning instructions to restore to protective finish.
If your pan becomes rusted, simply scour and re-season.
A well-seasoned pan will naturally darken with use.
Do not leave food in pan after cooking.
Do not wash in dishwasher.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter an 8-inch square baking dish.
For the filling:.
In a bowl, add the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, orange juice or apple cider, and vanilla, Carefully mix the ingredients together with a spatula, leaving the blueberries whole.
Set aside while you assemble the topping.
For the topping:
In the bowl of a mixer, add the flour, sugars, and butter.
Using the paddle attachment, incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks mealy or crumbly.
(This can be done by hand.)
Stir in the oats and nuts.
Pour the filling into an 8-inch square baking dish and evenly distribute the topping over the fruit.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.
Cool slightly and serve warm.



Preheat the oven to 180C.
Combine all the ingredients except for the water in a bowl and mix by hand.
Work the dough between your fingers to break the miso down into fine lumps.
Add the 100 ml water and mix.
If necessary, add more water until it's no longer floury.
After the dough comes together (to where it doesn't stick to your hands), knead it for 2-3 minutes.
Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.
On a dusted work surface, form the dough into desired shapes.
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, then they're ready.
For the rolls in the photo, I rolled them into balls, then slashed the tops in two places.
Since there's no oil in the dough, they will harden after they cool.
Steam them to enjoy a freshly baked taste.
I recommend you only steam the amount that you'll be serving.



Melt chocolate chips in microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted.
Add in the corn syrup, stirring until fully incorporated.

Fit it into YOUR schedule.
Pour in the rest of the molasses, oil, soy milk and salt.
Mix together.
Begin adding white flour, a 1/2 cup at a time.
After the third cup, it begins to get pretty dense.
I begin kneading the vegan bread in the bowl and it is still a bit sticky, so I'll add another 1/2 to 1 cup of flour as I knead the vegan bread.
Knead it for 5 to 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.
Cut the dough into two, equal parts.
Shape them into loaves and place them into two, 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 greased vegan bread pans.
(You can also make 24 rolls -- or 1 loaf, and 12 rolls -- whatever you want!
).
Cover pans with a towel in a warm place and let the dough double in size.
This will take at least an hour to an hour and a half.
Baking: Bake loaves at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes.
Rolls should be baked at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes.



Stir the chickpea flour and clarified butter together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until the mixture smells toasty, about 10 minutes.
Set aside until cool enough to handle.

Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 18 to 20 minutes.



In a large sauce pan, mash the strawberries with a fork or a potato masher.
Just try to do a bit at a time, other wise you'll miss some of them.
Combine sugar substitute with the pectin, salt, and a tsp of butter (to reduce foaming), and mix into the strawberry mush.
Put on stove and turn the burner to high heat.
This is when I added about half of the water, and some of the lemon juice.
Don't stop stirring, or it may burn.
I let this boil away for quite a long time.
I'd say at least ten minutes, until I couldn't stir it down from the boil.
I also added the rest of the water, and lemon juice closer to the end, simply to change the taste and consistency.
I took it off the heat, waited about two minutes, skimmed the top off, and canned it.
*CANNING TIP*
I like to can so that I can store food for a longer time.
To do this, boil your mason jars before you use them, lids shouldn't be boiled.
Just keep them in a sink of CLEAN HOT water until ready to use (I put the jars in too, to keep them sterile after boiling).
Then, put a deep pot on the stove with water to boil.
Take as many jars as you can fit into the pot, fill them with your hot jam almost to the top (about 1/4 inch)- IMPORTANT- WIPE THE TOP OF THE JAR COMPLETELY CLEAN, and tighten the lid, but NOT all the way.
Just a bit more closed than open.
Put them into the large pot, with water at least 1 inch over the top of each jar.
Boil for ten minutes.
After it's cooled a bit, take the jar, and tighten the rest of the way, as far as you can.
The top of the snap lid will be bent down, letting you know your seal is good.
This creates a vacuum seal on each jar, letting you store it up to 1 year.
THIS is the best way to can, but NOT necessarily the easiest.
It's time consuming and labour intensive.

It's really easy and retains the sweetness.
Mash the sweet potatoes while they are hot, then set aside to cool.
Combine the ingredients and mix in a circular motion.
Add the canola oil and mix.
Mix in the mashed sweet potato, then bring it all together into one ball of dough.
Thinly roll out the dough (to about 5mm thick) and cut using cookie cutters.

Drop by small tablespoons onto UNGREASED cookie sheet.
Bake for 11 minutes at 350F Watch them!



Combine all ingredients (reserve about 1/2 cup of flour) and mix thoroughly in a large mixing bowl.
Add reserved flour a tablespoon at a time to mixture until a soft, smooth dough is formed.
You may not need the whole amount or you may need more.
Anyway, add JUST enough flour until dough comes away from bowl and it doesn't stick to your fingers (ie the dough becomes manageable) Remember, the more flour you add while kneading, the heavier and drier your loaf will be.
Turn dough out on lightly greased surface and knead for a while, about 10mins.
Cover and let rise for about 1 hour, until puffy (dough might not double in bulk).
Transfer dough to a lightly greased surface and shape it into a 8" log.
Transfer log to a lightly greased loaf pan (8 1/2" x 4 1/2"), cover the pan with plastic proof cover (i just cover with a greased cling wrap, loosely).
Let dough rise for about 1 hour, until outer edge has risen about 1" over the rim of the pan.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Uncover pan and bake for 35-40mins, tenting lightly with foil for the final 10-15mins if the top is browning too quickly.
Remove bread from oven, take it out of the pan, and cool on wire rack.
After 15mins, brush with butter, if desired; to give loaf an exceptionally soft crust.
NOTE 1: I've tried substituting 2 tbsp lecithin granules for half of the butter (2 tbsp lecithin+ 2 tbsp butter)- it makes an even more tender loaf, and extends the shelf life a bit.
NOTE 2:You may also use 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk+ 1 1/8 cup of lukewarm water to replace the milk called for in recipe.
NOTE 3: Potato flour (1/4 cup) may be replaced with 1/3 cup potato flakes.

Put dry ingredients in a 2 1/2 quart glass, microwave-safe mixing bowl and whisk together until well blended and no lumps remain.
Then add the 3 cups milk a little at a time making sure there are no lumps.
Put in the microwave and cook for at least 3 minutes on high (if you have settings).
Then remove it from the microwave, whisk it and add the chocolate bits.
Then begin cooking at 1 minute intervals whisking after each, until the chocolate is melted and the pudding has thickened.
When pudding is thick and shiny remove it from the microwave and whisk in the vanilla.
Then pour into individual serving bowls and chill if you want it cold.
Now if you like a skin on top just cover the bowls with plastic wrap but if you want it skinless, then you will have to be sure the wrap is tight and touching the top of the pudding.



Combine the milk and chocolate sauce in a blender and blend for 5 seconds.
Add the ice cream and blend until smooth, about 10 seconds.
Serve immediately.



Put chocolate into heavy bowl.

Add salt and 2 cups of flour and stir until blended.
Add another 1 1/2 cups of flour and blend until too stiff to stir with a spoon.
Cut dough in half to get 2 (18-ounce) (1 ounce per inch) pieces.
If you like a thick crust, increase the amount of dough per inch or reduce the size of the pizza to a 14 or 16-inch pie.
With the dough in both hands knead (turn it inside itself so knuckles touch) to get some air pockets out and to get a round shape.
Knead about 7 times.
(Don't knead too hard or the dough will rip at the top).
At the bottom of the dough ball seal it by twisting the dough so that it is round on top and flat and sealed on the bottom.
Place the dough in a clean bowl (if dry, sprinkle with a little water), and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
Let the dough sit for between 30 to 60 minutes until it almost doubled in size.
Put the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour after it rises to gain elasticity.
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
Put the dough on a floured surface and push down on it with your fingertips to get rid of any bubbles.
Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to the size you choose.
Transfer the dough to an oiled pizza pan or baking sheet.
Or if you have a baking stone, sprinkle wooden pizza peel with flour, place dough on top and transfer directly to the stone.
Add sauce, cheese, and toppings as desired.
Keep toppings an inch away from the edge of the pie.
Cook pizza for approximately 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.

Dissolve the salt in the water.
Add to the flour in 3 batches, and fold it in with a spatula from the bottom of the bowl.
When the mixture is crumbly, press down with your hands while gathering in the flour to put it together.
Add a bit more water if needed.
When the dough has come together, knead with your palms really well.
By doing so, the dough will become firm and elastic.
While incorporating the dusted flour, adjust the consistency to the firmness of your earlobe.
When the surface has become smooth, wrap in cling film, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes.
The dough will become moist and easier to roll out.
I recommend preparing the toppings while you're waiting.
Dust a work surface with flour, divide the dough in half, and shape them into balls.
Press the dough flat onto the work surface.
Roll out back and forth and side to side with a rolling pin.
If you roll the dough onto the rolling pin diagonally at the end, the dough will become rectangular.
When the dough is about 3 mm thick, dust the dough with flour, fold it into thirds, and cut with a knife.
The noodles will expand when they're boiled, so they should be on the narrow side.
It's ok even if the width of the noodles is uneven.
Take your time!
Loosen the noodles, and dust with flour.
Prepare the soup.
Cook the noodles in plenty of hot water.
Stir only a few times at the beginning.
After 10-13 minutes, when the noodles have floated to the surface, drain in a colander.
Wash the noodles well with cold running water to remove the sliminess.
By doing so, the noodles will be firmer and more elastic.
Add the noodles in to the soup, and top with your toppings of your choice.
The noodles turn soft rather quickly, so boil the noodles right before you eat.

start by blending your flour, salt and sugar with a wisk in a large bowl, blend well for about one minute.
in a measuring cup ad your yeast and a half cup of (a little warmer than) luke warm water (not hot) stir, cover for 2 minutes.
Add one cup of (a little warmer than) luke warm water to your yeast mixture, cover.
Make a well in your flour mixture add yeast and water mix.
Cover the bowl with a warm damp cloth and a kitchen towel set aside for 10 minutes.
When the bubbles in the water are showing that lets you know your yeast is working so now its time to start mixing.
With a spatula ( i like to use plastic, it seems to stick less) start blending the flour mix with the water until a very sticky dough forms.
prepare a cutting board for kneeding by dusting it with flour.
dump your stick dough onto the board.
dust your hands and start kneeding the dough for about ten minutes.
( i like to press my dough into a pizza shape and fold it press again fold, stretch etc.
for about the first five minutes then i start a traditional kneeding action).
once a smooth texture is there ( carefull not to dry out your dough to much with flour) shape a round ball and coat with about 2 table spoons of EVVO.
Line a large bowl with wax paper and spray with non stick cooking spray, place dough in to rise.
Cover with the same warm damp cloth and kitchen towel and place in room temperature for 1 1/2 hours ( up to 3 hours) for first rise.
Once the dough has doubled in size prepare your cutting board with wax paper coated with cooking spray.
Remove dough from bowl onto prepared board.
using your hands, ( not a knife) pull apart into two pieces, shape loaves.
( i like to make the loaves about 8 - 10 inches long and about 4 inches withe but this is not really important, sometimes i braid them too!)
OK, now place another piece of wax paper sprayed with cooking spray over the top of both loaves cover with a towel and place in room temp for 1 hour ( second rise).
Now its time to prepare your oven.
Pre heat oven to 425. cover your baking stone with about 1/4 cup of corn meal and place in the oven on middle rack.
On a lower rack place pan with about 1 cup of water ( this keeps your crust from getting brown to quick) You want your baking stone to be really hot when its time to put the bread inches Once your hour is up your bread will have grown a bit ;) so remove your towels and wax paper with one hand ( im right handed) my left i place it gently on one loaf.
using my right hand i take the wax paper and turn the loaf upside down into my left hand being carefull not to disturb the shape and air in my loaf.
open the oven pull out your rack with the baking stone and place your loaf directly onto your cornmeal.
close oven.
set timer for 10 minutes.
after 10 minutes turn down oven to 400 and bake for 20 more minutes.
Watch that your crust isnt getting to brown (i like mine golden brown, think of the color of honey :) ) IF your crust is how you like it cover with a double fold of foil just over the top.
turn oven off and let stand in oven for 5 more minutes.
Remove to cooling rack.
Slice after 10 minutes and serve.

Bake at 400 for 15 minutes.
Roll in powdered sugar.



Lightly toast peanuts in a small pan to bring out their flavor.
Mix the peanuts with cinnamon and cayenne pepper by tossing a couple times in the medium bowl.
A bit of spiciness in sweets helps to heighten the flavors and punch of the other spices (like the cinnamon in this case).
This is a "trick" well known to chocolatiers and made famous by the movie Chocolat.
Over on the stove, combine the water and sugar in a saucepan.
I used a nonstick saucepan, but if you're using a traditional pan, then you'll want to rub the interior surface of the pan down with vegetable oil.
Over medium-high heat, dissolve the sugar into the water and brought it to a boil.
While the syrup was coming to a boil, prepare cookie sheet, non-stick or use parchment paper.
When the sugar turns a light amber color (if you're using a candy thermometer, look for 350 degrees, you're ready to introduce the peanuts.
Working quickly, use a wooden spoon to mix in the peanuts and spices.
It's important to work fast (and sure) from this point on because the syrup is rapidly cooling.
While you are stirring, the syrup will foam up, but the high sides of your saucepan will save you from a mess.
After the peanuts have been stirred in, pour the syrup parchment paper.
Syrup will flow out from the peanuts, so just use a wooden spoon to fold the excess sugar back onto the peanuts.
As it thickens it won't flow anymore.
At the same time, use the back of wooden spoon to press the peanuts down flat so you only have a single layer.
After the brittle cooled (about thirty minutes), wrap it in plastic wrap and broke it into 1 1/2 to 2 inch pieces with hands.
Placed them in a air tight container.



Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature.
Heat the maple syrup in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
When the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and allow the syrup to continue to boil and thicken for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a metal spoon.
Remove the very hot syrup from the heat.
Immediately add the walnuts to the syrup and stir to combine.
Transfer the glazed walnuts to a baking sheet with sides.
Use a metal spoon to spread the walnuts evenly over one half of the baking sheet.
Set aside.
Place the sugar and lemon juice in a 3-quart saucepan.
Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand).
Caramelize the sugar by heating for 10 to 10 1/2 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wire whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it caramelizes.
Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the unsweetened chocolate and stir to dissolve.
Immediately and carefully pour the caramelized mixture over the walnuts, covering all the nuts.
Allow to harden at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
Invert the praline onto a clean, dry cutting board (it should pop right out of the baking sheet), this will keep the shiny side looking shiny after cutting.
Use a sharp serrated slicer to cut (use a sawing motion) the praline into desired size pieces.
Store the pralines in a tightly sealed plastic container until ready to devour.



Heat the cherries, sugar, rosemary, and water in a saucepan over high heat.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.

1.
Prep a baking dish.
For thicker bars, try a 7x11 or a couple of bread pans.
For thinner bars, a 13x9 will work.
Grease the pan or lay down non-stick foil.
2.
In a great big bowl: mix the oats, rice cereal, dried fruit, M&Ms, chocolate chips, and peanuts.
Stir it all together with a large spatula.
Have the spatula close and handy!
3.
In a medium-sized microwave safe bow, combine the honey and peanut butter.
Microwave for 30-45 seconds.
Stir until it is thoroughly mixed.
4.
Pour your honey mixture into the oat mixture.
Now, be quick!
Coat the oat mixture with the honey mixture.
This is easier to do while it is still hot.
5.
Once coated, press the mixture into your prepared pan.
You can grease your hands and press.
I like to take cling wrap and wrap that around the bottom of a bread pan.
Then, I use that to press the bars into the pan really firmly.
This is necessary for the bars to stick together.
6.
Cover and put it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Cut and enjoy!
Do not attempt to cut them before one hour or they will be a crumbly, honey gooey mess.
They will still be tasty, though.
Like many homemade granola bars, freezing these for a little while helps them stick together.
Store at room temperature, in the fridge or the freezer.

Serves 6.



preheat oven to 400c
add dry ingredents together
slowy add the water and oil start with 3/4 cup water and add more as required
knead dough for 4 mins or until silky
makes 2 12" pizzas



Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and water in a mixing bowl.
If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute.
If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute, until well blended.
The dough should be coarse and sticky.
Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour.
If making ciabatta, drizzle the olive oil over the dough; if making mini baguettes, omit the oil.
Then mix on medium-low speed using the paddle attachment, or by hand using a large, wet spoon or wet hands, for 1 minute.
The dough should become smoother but will still be very soft, sticky, and wet.
Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface.
With wet or oiled hands, reach under the front end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough.
Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball.
The dough should be significantly firmer, though still very soft and fragile.
Place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Repeat this process three more times, completing all repetitions within 40 minutes.
(You can also perform the stretch and folds in the bowl, as shown on page 17.)
After the final stretch and fold, immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days.
The dough will rise, possibly to double its original size, in the refrigerator.
(If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)
Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 1 hour before baking for mini baguettes, and 3 hours in advance for ciabatta (or an hour earlier if the dough hasnt increased to 1 1/2 times its original size in the refrigerator overnight).
To make ciabatta, about 1 hour after taking the dough out of the refrigerator, line the back of a sheet pan with parchment paper and generously dust the entire surface with flour.
Use a wet or oiled bowl scraper to transfer the dough to the work surface, taking care to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid degassing it.
Dust the top surface of the dough with flour and also flour your hands.
Using your hands or a metal pastry scraper, gently coax and pat the dough into a rough square measuring about 9 inches on each side, still taking care to degas it as little as possible.
For small ciabatta, cut the dough into 3 even strips about 3 inches wide and 9 inches long (the pieces will each weigh about 12 ounces or 340 grams).
For larger ciabatta, cut the dough in half.
With floured hands, gently fold the dough in thirds, like folding a letter but without applying any pressure.
Gently roll the folded dough in the dusting flour to coat it, then lift the dough and place it on the parchment paper, again rolling it in the dusting flour on the parchment.
Rest the dough seam side down on the parchment and repeat with the other pieces of dough.
Mist the tops of the dough pieces with spray oil and loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap or a clean, lint-free towel.
After 1 hour, gently roll the pieces over so the seam side is up, lift and cradle each piece with floured hands, and, working from the underside, gently coax it to a length of 5 inches (for small ciabatta) to 7 inches (for large ciabatta).
Lay the pieces back on the parchment seam side up.
Straighten the sides of each piece with your hands or a pastry scraper so that they are more rectangular than oblong, mist with spray oil again, then cover loosely and proof for 1 hour more.
About 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C) or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30).
Slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the stone; if you arent using a baking stone, simply put the whole pan into the oven.
Pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C).
Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the crust is a rich brown (streaked with the dusting flour).
The bread should puff a little, and the crust should be hard when tapped (itll soften as it cools).
Cool on a wire rack for 45 minutes before slicing.
To make mini baguettes, about 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C), or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30).
After the dough has been out for 1 hour, generously dust the entire surface of a wooden peel with flour or line the back of a sheet pan with parchment paper (you can either dust the parchment with flour or mist it with spray oil so that you can slide and move the dough if need be).
Use a wet or oiled bowl scraper to transfer the dough from the bowl to the work surface, taking care to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid degassing it.
Dust the top surface of the dough with flour and also flour your hands.
Using your hands or a metal pastry scraper, gently coax and pat the dough into a rough square about 8 inches on each side, still taking care to degas it as little as possible.
Cut off a slice of dough about 1 1/2 inches wide and roll it into the dusting flour to lightly coat it and keep it from sticking to the remainder of the dough.
Working with floured hands and tools, carefully transfer the slice to the prepared peel or parchment paper, cradling it with both hands to keep it from stretching too much.
You can straighten it by spreading your hands underneath the dough as you lay it down; it should elongate slightly, to 9 to 10 inches.
Repeat with the rest of the dough, placing the pieces 1 inch apart, until the peel or parchment is full.
If you cant fit all of the pieces on the peel or parchment, bake those that are ready before cutting the remainder.
Its better to work in manageable batches than to try to cram all of them in the oven, especially if your stone or oven wont easily hold all of them.
Scoring the dough is an option, but because it risks degassing the dough, I advise against it until you have made these a few times.
Slide the mini baguettes onto the baking stone using short, quick back-and-forth motions with the peel, or by sliding the parchment paper onto the stone.
Pour 1/2 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 475F (246C).
Bake for 12 to 18 minutes total, rotating the pan as needed for even browning.
The crust should be a rich brown, the loaves should puff a little, and the crust should be hard when tapped (the crust will soften slightly as the bread cools).
Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes.
For an interesting ciabatta texture and a nice design on the surface of the bread, mix a small amount of coarse rye flour or whole wheat flour in with the dusting flour.



*** This dough will be very dry.
Resist the urge to add in water.

Mean while I added fruit to a pan (doesn't matter what kind).
These were just what I happened to have.
Stir in 1/2 of the juice saving the rest to mix with cornstarch.
Heat, then add pepper flakes, and cinnamon.
I added more than I have suggested but as they say you can always add but can not take away.
Mix remaining juice with cornstarch until bubbling.Add more sauce with the cornstarch if you prefer it to have extra juice.
By this time the pork should be done.
Note: adjust types or amounts of fruit to your liking.
I could not find a recipe so just put it together.
Spoon sauce over pork, and serve with your favourite side dishes.
Note: you end up with extra fruit in the can' but you can of course double the recipe or store the extra in containers).
I served it with baked potato, and corn that I cut off the cob.

If not cover with tin foil and bake for another 10 minutes.
Barely no cake mixture should stick to the skewer.
Leave it to cool for at least 30 minutes before removing from the tin.
Leave the cake to cool down in the fridge for at least an hour if applying icing on top of it.
Make a lemon icing by mixing the icing sugar with the lemon juice.
Add the lemon juice little by little, mixing with a whisk, till your desired consistency is achieved.



In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt.
Using your fingers, work in the butter until large, moist crumbs form.

Roast the butternut fingers: Set oven at 350 deg F/180 deg Celsius.
Mix the olive oil, sugar, vinegar, mustard and salt with a whisk, until it emulsifies, in other words, it forms a thickened mixture.
It's best to whisk until at least some of the sugar melts.
Use a nonstick oven tin, or spray with nonstick spray.
Place butternut fingers in one layer on tin, then with a small spoon dribble the mixture over them and shake, or lift over and over with a spatula so all these fries are covered in some of the dressing.
Roast 20 - 25 minutes, until some of the fingers just begin to turn brown or dark at the edges: do not burn.
(Do ahead, cool, cover and keep in fridge).
Prepare the rest of the veggies.
Wash the little tomatoes, pat dry the feta cheese, wash and slice the green onions and slice and chop the cucumber.
I also like to heat the nuts in a pan to crisp them, but watch out, they burn easily.
Slice the iceberg, then add the rest of the ingredients as you like.
Don't toss the salad because you don't want to break up the roasted butternut fingers.
Use roomy dessert bowls for this salad, and let everyone drizzle vinaigrette over the salad, to taste.
Have a pepper mill ready for those who want pepper.



Brown ground beef and drain away the fat.

Gently press both sides of cookie into granulated sugar that has been spread out thinly on plate.
Bake for about 20 minutes or until slightly browning.



It's important to note that you should never knead or massage the dough throughout the steps.
This is the key to crispy-crunchy biscuits.
Put the cake flour, whole wheat flour, and the salt into a plastic bag (like the kind they keep in the fruit & vegetable aisles of supermarkets).
Make sure the bag has some air inside.
Hold it in your hands and shake to mix the ingredients together.
Pour the oil into the center of the dry ingredients.
Hold the bag to let some air in, and gently shake the contents again to blend the oil with the flour.
Shake the bag until the dough becomes crumbly.
Don't worry if there's still some oil stuck to the bag at this point.
Press and break up any particularly large lumps of flour and oil, and rub the contents gently with your fingers from over the bag to remove any excess oil that's stuck to the surface of the platic bag.
There's no need to pay too much attention to what you're doing; just keep at it for about 1 minute or so.
Add the maple syrup, let some air into the bag, and shake to blend everything together.
Try adding a little bit more maple syrup if the dough does't come together.
Press and stretch the dough over the bag using the palm of your hands, and fold.
Repeat for a few times until there are no more powdery lumps.
Preheat the oven to 170C (or 338 F).
Roll the dough out over the bag into about 4-5 mm thick.
It's easier if you fold the bag into a square.
Be careful because the dough is quite fragile.
Cut with a cookie cutter, and align onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Bring together any leftover dough, roll it out, fold, roll out again, then cut out your biscuit shapes.
Bake in the top rack of the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes.
Once baked, take them out from the oven and let cool without removing from the pan.
Note: I tried changing the maple syrup to honey.
The dough became really sticky.
They burned after baking for 16 minutes!
A shame.



Set aside 1 cup of flour (for dusting).
Mix all of the dry ingredients except for the flour in the first step.
Melt the butter in the water in a separate bowl.
Mix the dry and wet ingredients together by hand with a wooden spoon.
Knead dough on counter for 5 minutes.
Let rest in greased pan for 10-20 to rise.
Put it in a warm place (On top of the pre-heated oven works great) and make sure to put a damp paper towel over everything while its rising.
Roll out on the counter and roll up like a jelly roll.
I like to brush a little bit of melted butter over everything before I roll it, but thats optional.
Let rest in greased pan for another 30-49 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes.
Stab with a wooden skewer through the middle to check if its done- when you pull the skewer out and its clean, the bread is done.
If there is still some dough-goo on it, let the bread bake for a few more minutes.
You can add more of the herbs or switch them entirely; this recipe is very flexible and great to experiment with.
This also makes AMAZING pizza dough!
You can also use this recipe to make great homemade cinnamon rolls!
All you have it do is this:.
Use the same ingredients except for the oregano, basil, and garlic.
Put in a little bit of cinnamon (to taste) and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.
When you get to step 7, slather on lots of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon (all to your preference).
Roll it all up and slice.
Melt more butter and cinnamon in the baking pan and put the slices in whatever pan you prefer.
Bake for 15 minutes Make an easy vanilla glaze to put on top.
Obviously this is not a healthy recipe....
Which is why it tastes so good!
You can put in as much butter, brown sugar, etc as you like, its a very flexible recipe.

I changed the recipe to add the option of substituting katakuriko or joshinko for the cornstarch.
Put the cake flour, white sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl and mix well with a whisk.
Pour the olive oil into the bowl in a swirling motion as if you are drawing circles.
Using a rubber spatula, mix with a cutting motion until the oil and flour have combined and the mixture looks crumbly.
If the dough won't come together when you squeeze it with your hands, add a little more olive oil.
Put the crumbly dough into a plastic bag.
Squeeze the bag briefly with your hands to bring the dough together.
Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (you can skip this step if you don't have time).
Take the dough out and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes (cold dough is hard to work with).
Form into a 3cm cylinder and flatten the sides.
Preheat the oven to 320F/160C.
I use a milk carton to make a sort of "sushi mat" in order to form the dough.
Press and squeeze firmly to shape the dough.
Use a knife to cut the dough into 1cm pieces.
I made square cookies, but you can make any shape you like.
Bake in an oven preheated to 320F/160C for 10 minutes.
Then turn the oven down to 302F/150C and bake for 5 more minutes.
Be careful not to let the cookies brown.
When little cracks appear on the surface of the cookies, they're done.
They crumble easily, so let them cool before handling them.
This is the olive oil I generally use.
You can clearly taste the olive oil flavor in these shortbread cookies, so I recommend using a good quality olive oil.
I use scissors to cut out a piece of milk carton and then fold it to use in shaping the dough.
It's really easy and convenient and the cookies turn out beautifully.
Shortbread will keep for a while, but the special flavor of the olive oil will not last long, so eat these up as soon as possible.
I changed the recipe to add the option of substituting katakuriko or joshinko for the cornstarch.

Bring to a full boil, cook and stir for 2 minute or until thickened.



Note: Recipe can be made with ALL A/P flour.
You will need a large bread bowl, a rolling pin, and unglazed quarry tiles or several baking sheets, or alternatively a castiron or other heavy skillet or griddle at least 9 inches in diameter.
Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large bread bowl.
Stir to dissolve.
Add whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, then 1 cup white flour.
Stir 100 times (one minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten in the flour.
Let this sponge rest for at least 10 minutes or as long as 2 hours.
Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil.
Mix well.
Add white flour, one cup at a time.
When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic.
Return the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1/2 hours.
Gently punch down.
Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or less.
If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening of the bag.
This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do).
From day to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up to one week.
The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the taste of the bread.
Dough should be brought to room temperature before baking.
This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out into circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick.
You can also of course make smaller breads.
Size and shape all depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the following baking tips apply: Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap all around to allow air to circulate.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest.
Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly floured hands.
Roll out each piece to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter.
You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake.
Cover rolled out breads, but do not stack.
Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets.
Bake each bread for 3 or 4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full"balloon" or until it is starting to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first.
If there are seams or dry bits of dough- or for a variety of other reasons- your bread may not go into a full"balloon".
Don't worry, it will still taste great.
The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently"balloon.
"But even then, if you're like us, it won't always"balloon" fully and you won't mind because the taste will still be wonderful.
When baked, remove, place on a rack for about five minutes to let cool slightly, then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft).
When first half of the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest of dough, or store in refrigerator for later use, as described above.
You can also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give you smaller breads.

Success Hints: Golden raisins give this bread its light flavor and look.
Dark raisins may be subsituted but will make a darker, slightly heavier loaf.
The sugar in the raisins creates a darker crust; use your machine's"light crust setting" if it has one.
Dried butter milk can generally be found in the baking goods section of your supermarket.
If you can't find buttermilk, regular dried milk can be substituted.
If using delayed time bake, place raisins atop dry ingredients away from liquid.
This recipe can be made using the regular, rapid and delayed time bake cycles.

First, defrost the phyllo dough.
Do this by shredding the phyllo in a bowl continuously till completely defrosted.
While you are doing the shredding, start adding the butter(this is done so the dough does not stick together).
When this process is complete and the dough is shredded thoroughly, separate the dough into two equal portions.
In a well buttered 9x13-inch pan, spread out the dough thoroughly, but do not compress.
Once the dough is spread evenly, start preparing the Ricotta cheese.
Make patties, similar to hamburger patties, but with the cheese.
Lay the cheese patties onto the prepared dough in the pan.
Once the layer of Ricotta cheese is completely covering the dough, lay the second half of the dough unto the cheese so that it is evenly distributed.
Preheat the oven to 350F Once preheated, place the pan in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes.
What you need to look for, is that the dough browns.
Once this occurs, you will need a larger pan in which you will flip the Knafe so the the bottom is on top.
Then bake again till the browning occurs on the adjacent side.
Once browned on both sides, the Knafe is finished.
The last step is to top the Knafe with the pine nuts and the sweet syrup and enjoy!
Sweet Syrup:.
In a pot, combine 3 cups of sugar with 1 1/2 cups of water.
Mix and heat over stove till boiling process.
Once boiling add a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and boil for a few minutes more for thickening process.
Let cool and use over Knafe once done baking.

Make sure all of your cooking implements are very clean before you start.
You will be using a medium sized pot, a large pyrex (or other non-metal) bowl, and some measuring tools and stirrers.
It also helps to have a thermometer.
I usually pour boiling water over them.
Stir the agave into the milk, and put it on the stove at medium heat.
Slowly add the milk powder to the milk, stirring constantly so as to avoid scalding.
Add the vanilla and stir well right before the milk reaches the boiling point.
When the milk just begins to bubble, or alternately, when it hits 210 degrees F (just below boiling), remove it from the heat and transfer to a non-metal bowl (something with thick sides works best).
Let the milk sit until it's just cool enough to hold your finger in for fifteen seconds (or until it hits 105 degrees F).
Your 1/4 cup of yogurt (starter) should be at room temperature.
Add enough of the milk to your starter to mix it into a thin liquid, and add this back to the milk, making sure it's stirred in very well.
Put plastic wrap over the bowl, wrap it in a small towel, and place it somewhere warm where it won't be disturbed (I use a rice cooker on the warm setting).
Let it sit for 6-12 hours, making sure not to peek or otherwise move the bowl.
The time will vary depending on how warm it is where the yogurt is left to ferment, but as a rule, warmer spots will take less time and cooler spots will take more, but leaving the yogurt anywhere warmer than 110 degrees should be avoided, as it may kill the active cultures.
For me, nine hours works best.
When it has finished fermenting, the plastic will puff out and your yogurt will be sitting in a yellowish syrup.
This is just the whey, and it is up to you whether or not you want to drain it off.
Place the yogurt in the fridge and let it get cold before serving.
Reduce the milk powder to 3 tbsp and omit the agave and vanilla for plain yogurt that can be used in recipes.

The plastic bag is the easiest and least messy option.
Add in the remaining ingredients and ensure thoroughly mixed.
Pour the potatoes out onto a flat tray in a single layer.
I like to use cookies sheets.
You dont need to grease the trays as the potatoes are already coated.
Place in the oven and turn after 20 minutes.
Cook until done to your liking.
Mine usually take 40 to 50 minutes.

Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a food processor.
Turn the machine on and add 1 cup water and the oil through the feed tube.
Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water, a little at a time, until the mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch.
If dry, add another tablespoon or two of water and process for another 10 seconds.
(In the unlikely event that the mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.)
Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round dough ball.
Put the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let rise until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours.
(You can cut this rising time short if you are in a hurry, or you can let the dough rise more slowly, in the refrigerator, for up to 6 or 8 hours.)
Proceed to step 4 or wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to a month.
(Defrost in a covered bowl in the refrigerator or at room temperature.)
When the dough is ready, form it into a ball and divide it into 2 or more pieces if you like; roll each piece into a round ball.
Place each ball on a lightly floured surface, sprinkle with a little flour, and cover with plastic wrap or a towel.
Let rest until the balls puff slightly, about 20 minutes.
Proceed as the individual pizza recipes direct.



Preheat oven to 350 F.
Spread oats in the bottom of a 9x9-inch rimmed baking pan and toast in the oven until fragrant and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
While the oats are browning, put the Cheerios, chocolate chips, peanuts, and raisins into a large bowl.
Set aside.
Pour the brown rice syrup, brown sugar, and peanut butter into a small, heavy pot and warm over medium heat to dissolve the sugar and melt the ingredients together.
Heat until its a thin, smooth syrup, stirring occasionally.
Once the ingredients are melted, stir in the vanilla.
When the oats are done, remove them from oven and add them to the bowl with the Cheerios mixture.
Mix well.
Lightly grease the bottom and sides of the pan that you cooked the oats in.
Drizzle the hot syrup over the cereal mixture and use a wooden spoon to quickly work the ingredients together so it is one, uniform lump, with no dry bits left out.
Put it immediately into the greased baking pan and use the spoon to press it down very firmly, filling out the entire pan.
Once the mixture has cooled enough to touch, use your hands to press down on the mixture further until it is one solid, uniform block.
Leave it to cool for 30 minutes.
Then, invert the bars out of the pan onto a cutting board.
Turn it right-side up, and cut it into 25 bars.
Store in an airtight container.

In a large bowl, combine the honey, brown sugar, butter, and salt.
Add the oats and wheat germ, then stir the mixture until it's evenly blended.
Spread the granola onto the prepared cookie sheets and bake for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through to keep it from burning and encourage even baking.
Remove the pans from the oven and stir the granola again.
Add the coconut, then return the pans to the oven to bake 10 minutes more.
Note: Keep an eye on the granola during this period and stir it occasionally so that it doesn't burn.
Remove the granola from the oven and stir it one last time.
Allow it to cool completely on the pans, about 15 minutes.
When it has cooled, stir in the dried mango, the dried pineapple, and the toasted macadamia nuts, then transfer the granola to an airtight container.
The granola can be stored for up to four weeks.
Berry Blast: This subtly sweet granola variation offers a delicious alternative for those who don't like nuts.
To make it, simply omit the coconut and replace the nuts, pineapple, and mango with a cup of dried berries of your choice.
Recommended Combination: dried blueberries and dried cherries.
Makes 6 cups.
Vanilla Almond: While this variation appeals to those who prefer "plain" granola, it doesn't skimp on taste.
Make a batch by adding a tablespoon of vanilla extract to the butter/honey mixture and replace the coconut with a cup of sliced almonds.
Omit the nuts, pineapple, and mango.
Makes 6 cups.

In a large bowl, cover the soy beans with 3 inches of cold water.
Cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.
Drain the soy beans and transfer them to a blender.
Add 3 cups of the filtered water and puree at high speed until as smooth as possible.
Line a large sieve with a clean cotton napkin or 3 layers of cheesecloth and set the sieve over a heatproof bowl.
In a large pot, bring 3 cups of the filtered water to a boil.
Add the soy bean puree and bring just to a boil (be careful not to let it boil over).
Boil over moderately high heat for exactly 8 minutes, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula to prevent sticking and scorching.
Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared sieve.
Let stand until just cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes.
Gather the ends of the napkin or cheesecloth and squeeze to extract as much of the soy milk as possible; the remaining solids should be nearly dry.
Discard the solids and skim off any foam from the soy milk.
You should have about 4 cups of soy milk.
In a large, clean saucepan, bring the soy milk to just below a simmer.

Here is a simple, clean paleo jerky.
First, you want a nice piece of meat.
Of course, grain-fed beef is always the top choice.
Flank is a good type of beef.
You could also use a rump roast, round steak, or even brisket.
The key is find a lean piece of meat.
Freeze the meat for about 30 minutes to make it easier to slice.
Most people enjoy a tender jerky, so cut against the grain, but others prefer to cut with the grain.
Either will result in delicious jerky.
The slices should be 1/4 inch thick.
Try to cut them evenly to ensure a thorough dehydration process.
You will need to put the slices in a glass bowl (or Ziploc Bag) with the other ingredients, shake, and let sit in the fridge overnight (at least 4 hours), turning or shaking it if possible.
When ready, lay slices (not touching) on a dehydrator for 3-4 hours at 145-155 degrees F. Or use the oven at its lowest setting.
Check at the 2-hour point and every 30 minutes thereafter until done to your liking.
The jerky should be dry but still pliable.
Make sure you store the jerky in airtight container and eat in 5-7 days.
Keep in the fridge for longer storage.



Bring the milk to a boil and add vinegar to the boiling milk to seperate whey.
Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff onto a muslin cloth.
Pour some cold water over the curd to cool and wash it.
Throw the water and hang the cloth for 15 to 20 minutes to let the excess water drip off.
Put the curd in a food processor or blender and blend.
You may add just a little (1 teaspoon or so) water while blending, if the curd is too dry and will not blend.
Be very careful so as not to add any extra water.
Remove the paste and make small balls.
Boil water in a wide vessel.
If not, put more water and increase the quantity of sugar proportionately.
Add sugar to boiling water to make a light syrup.
Continue boiling the syrup and gently drop the curd balls in.
Cook the balls in the boiling syrup for 30 to 40 minutes.
Let cool.

Catch, clean and filet salmon (river or supermarket).
Leave skin on one side of filets.
Wash filets in cold water and lay out on a large plastic tray (no metal), red side up!
Ensure tray is at least as deep as salmon filets.
Sprinkle garlic salt evenly over all filets.
Generously coat meat side of each filet with rock salt.
Layer sugar evenly over rock salt.
Leave stand covered in refrigerator overnight (at least 8 hours).
Check every 2 or 3 hours and drain excess liquid.
(The liquid magically appears as the rock salt draws the liquid out, and sucks the sugar into the meat).
Remove filets from tray, rinse under cold water and place evenly on smoking racks, skin side down.
Allow 20 minutes to dry.
Use electric"cold smoker" (Little Chief), with apple and hickory wood chips.
Place racks in smoker and close.
I have an old blanket that is wrapped around smoker if it is too cold outside (less than 50 degrees farenheit).
Remove ashes and add new wood chips about every 2 hours.
Smoke for 6 to 9 hours, depending on the thickness of filets.
Salmon should be a lovely dark orange color and will be flaky when you poke and twist with a fork.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly coat a 9 inch square (or round) cake pan with vegetable oil spray.
In the work bowl of a food processor, process the cranberries a few times until approximately quartered (or chop them by hand).
Transfer the cranberries to a small bowl.
Add the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and powder, and spices) to the bowl of the food processor and process briefly to blend.
In a large mixing bowl, mix together the remaining (wet) ingredients.
Then add in the dry ingredients and cranberries to the mixing bowl, using the muffin method to combine (e.g., mix as little as possible, leaving the batter airy and light).
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake until the bread has shrunk slightly away from the sides of the pan and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean (about 45 minutes, or 55 if using a loaf pan).
If you cool it in the pan briefly (for about 5 minutes) it will be easier to remove it from the pan, but do not leave it sitting in the pan too long or it will get soggy on the bottom.
Turn onto a rack to cool completely before putting in a airtight container, where it will keep for about 4 days, after which it begins to dry out.

Blend on high until smooth and frothy.



Blend the raspberries in a food processor until pureed, about 1 minute.
Pour into a large bowl and add the agave nectar, water, and lemon juice.
Strain the mixture through a sieve, using a rubber spatula to help push the puree through.
Discard the seeds.
Refrigerate for several hours or overnight until ready to freeze.
Pour into the ice cream maker and follow the manufacturers instructions for freezing.

Remove shrimp, and allow marinade to cook a little longer, until a little reduced sauce forms (there won't be a ton, just enough).
Drizzle shrimp with remaining sauce and serve immediately.



Slice each breast and thigh across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick strips.
When cutting the breast tenders, remove and discard the silvery strip of tendon.
Keep any visible fat for richness, but trim away any cartilage or sinewy bits, as they wont grind well.
To make the marinade, in a bowl large enough to fit the chicken, whisk together the baking powder, tapioca starch, sugar, fish sauce, and oil.
Add the chicken and use a rubber spatula to mix well.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight.
The chicken will stiffen as it sits.
Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and use a spoon to break it apart.
Working in batches, grind the chicken in a food processor until a smooth, stiff, light pink paste forms.
(This step takes several minutes and the machine will get a good workout.)
Stop the machine occasionally to scrape down the sides.
When you are finished, there should be no visible bits of chicken and the paste should have a slight sheen.
Using the rubber spatula, transfer each batch to another bowl, taking care to clean well under the blade.
The paste is ready to use, or it can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
For long-term keeping, divide it into 1/2- and 1-pound portions (a scant 1 cup paste weighs 1/2 pound), wrap in a double layer of plastic wrap, and freeze for up to 2 months.
To make gio the old-fashioned way, you must first hand pound the meat and then add the marinade ingredients.
Use a large Thai stone mortar and pestle, which can be found reasonably priced at Asian restaurant-supply and housewares shops.
My 9-inch-wide mortar has a 5-cup capacity bowl that is 6 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches deep.
The 8-inch-long pestle is about 2 inches wide at the base.
Select a pestle that fits your hand comfortably.
(Stone pestles, heavier than the wooden one mentioned in the chapter introduction, make pounding easier.)
To minimize physical strain, I sit on a low kitchen stool and put the mortar on a solid table or box, with the rim of the mortar slightly below my knee.
You may also sit on the floor with the mortar between your legs.
Place a thick towel under the mortar to protect the work surface.
Regardless of your setup, you want to sit astride the mortar and efficiently use your upper body strength to work the pestle.
It takes about 35 minutes to produce a full batch of paste, so you may want to halve the recipe.
To yield gio that is close to the traditional version, pound pork (see Note, above), which works better than chicken.
The beef mixture used for making Beef, Dill, and Peppercorn Sausage (page 161) is also a good candidate for hand pounding.
Cut the meat into 1/4-inch-thick strips as instructed in the recipe.
Blot the meat dry with paper towels to prevent it from sliding around the mortar.
In a small bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients.
Set aside near the pounding station.
(Hand-pounded gio doesnt traditionally call for leavener and starch, but I find that they guarantee a silkier result that is neither too dense nor too firm.)
Put about 1/2 pound of the meat (or a quantity you find manageable) in the mortar and start pounding with a steady rhythm, pausing only to remove any gristly bits that come loose.
After about 4 minutes, the meat should have gathered into a mass and, perhaps, even stuck to the pestle, allowing you to use the pestle to lift the meat from the mortar and pound it down again.
Keep pounding for another 2 minutes to make the meat cohere into a smooth mass that resembles a ball of dough.
Use a rubber spatula or plastic dough scraper to transfer the meat to a bowl.
Repeat with the remaining meat.
Add all the marinade ingredients to the meat, stirring with a fork until the marinade is no longer visible.
In batches, pound the meat for about 3 minutes longer to combine all the ingredients well.
You should hear a suction noise as air is mixed in.
The finished paste will feel firm and look ragged, and small nuggets of meat will be suspended in the paste.
Transfer the paste to a clean bowl and repeat with the remaining meat.



In a roasting pan mix the sugar and the pear.
Cook in a 350 to 400 degree oven stiring frequently until it becomes a golden translucent color.
Cooking time could vary because of heat and how small the pieces.
sometimes half way I take my imersion blender to it to speed things up.
When it is done place into jelly or pint jars that have been warmed in hot water.
Clean off the lip of jars and place boiled canning lids and srew on the rings and let seal.
If lid of jar isn't cleaned off properly the jars won't seal.
Enjoy!

Heat the milk and water together in a small saucepan till they are 'hand hot'.
Then pour into a jug, stir in the sugar and dried yeast and leave it in a warm place for 10-15 minutes till there is a good frothy head on it.
Meanwhile, sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre.
When the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it all into the mixing bowl.
Slowly work the flour into the liquid with a wooden spoon.
Beat well at the end to make a perfectly smooth batter.
Cover the mixing bowl with a tea-towel and leave to stand in a warm place for about 45 minutes - by which time, the batter will have become light and frothy.
When you're ready to cook, grease the insides of the cooking rings very well and add a little oil to your frying pan before placing it over a medium heat.
When the pan is hot, arrange the rings in the frying pan and spoon 1 tablespoon of the batter into each ring.
Let them cook for 4 or 5 minutes: first tiny bubbles will appear on the surface and then, suddenly, they will burst, leaving the traditional holes.
Now take a large spoon and fork, lift off the rings and turn the crumpets over.
Cook on the second side for about 1 minute only.
Re-grease and reheat the rings and pan before cooking the next batch.
Serve the crumpets while still warm, generously buttered and topped with anything that takes your fancy.
Strawberry jam or lemon curd are particularly good.
If you are making your teatime treat in advance, then reheat them by toasting lightly on both sides before serving.
(Bought crumpets need toasting on the highest setting of your toaster to give you a similar result).

With floured rolling pin, roll dough just 1 or 2 rolls to flatten the top, leaving dough about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (your preference).
Roll as little as possible, as working dough makes it less tender.
With 2 or 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter dipped in flour, cut biscuits and place biscuits, almost touching, on an ungreased baking sheet.
After cutting biscuits, gather scraps and re-roll dough, cutting more biscuits in the same manner.
Brush the tops of biscuits with buttermilk and bake for 15 minutes or until they are pale golden brown.
Serve.
MAKE AHEAD: Freeze biscuits, not touching, on baking sheet.
Freeze until solid.
Remove biscuits and place in freezer, resealable plastic bag, To bake, place frozen biscuits on ungreased baking sheet, bake at 400 degrees until golden brown, 20-30 minutes (this is a guess).
SUBSTITUTIONS: If you want to use self-rising flour, omit the salt and use only 2 teaspoons.
baking powder.
NOTE: These can be cut into smaller biscuits and baked a little less.
Use for baby ham biscuit or appetizers or a brunch.



this is a basic rub.
tweak it as you desire.
great for slow cooking or grilling.
mix all ingredients in a bowl with a wire wisk.
place mixture in a zip lock bag and refrigerate overnight to let the flavors marry
use on beef, pork, lamb or chicken.
it will keep for a few weeks in the fridge.
if you need it right away you can combine ingredients in a double boiler but make sure to mix frequently and break apart lumps with your fingers to prevent sugar from caking up.
keep at low heat to prevent carmelization.



FOR THE FILLING: Combine all the ingredients in a 12-inch skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Cook until the cranberries break down and the mixture begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.
FOR THE TOPPING: Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a food processor.
Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal, Transfer to a medium bowl and fold in the buttermilk until a shaggy dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper and roll it into a 12-inch round.
Place the dough over the thickening filling.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the dough is puffed and doubled in size, about 15 minutes.
To serve, cut the dough into 8 wedges.
Transfer each wedge to a serving bowl, and spoon the filling over the top.
Serve hot or warm.
(The pot pie is best eaten on the day it is made).

Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 - 7 minutes or until elastic.
Roll out to 3/4 cm thick.
Bake in a 220 degree celcius fan forced oven for 10-12 minutes.
Note: You can brush the base with a little garlic oil if you are going to bake the base first before putting your pizza ingredients on (this gives a crispier base).
Alternatively you can load your pizza toppings on the unbaked base, which will give you a lovely softer pizza base.



Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
Add flour, salt and olive oil in a food processor.
Once it is on, pour in 1/2 cup water.
Go on running processor until dough forms a firm ball, rides around on blade and is not at all sticky.
(If you prefer, whisk together the water and oil and add this to machine all at once.)
Cut dough into 12 small balls this is easiest if you cut the ball in half, then half again, then into thirds and flatten each into a 3- to 4-inch patty.
On a well-floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each patty into a 6 to 8 inch circle.
The shapes can be irregular, but dough should be so thin you can almost see through it.
Place dough on ungreased cookie sheets, sprinkle with sea salt if desired.
You may find using a silicone baking mat helpful.
Prick thoroughly and completely all over with a fork to prevent any puffing up.
Bake for about 2 to 3 minutes, keeping a very close eye on breads they can burn very quickly.
Once they begin to brown, flip and cook for another minute or so on the other side.
Repeat with all the remaining dough and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.

Divide into 12 pieces and shape each into a smooth ball.
Cover lightly with plastic film and let rest about 15 minutes.
For each tortilla, flatten one ball into a 4 or 5-inch patty, then roll into a 9-inch round, rolling from center to edges.
Turn tortilla often, stretching dough as you carefully peel it off board.
Make sure these are paper thin, the thinner, the better!
As each tortilla is shaped, place on preheated, dry, heavy griddle or heavy wide frying pan over medium-high heat.
On a preheated electric griddle set at medium-high heat or about 375 degrees.
Almost immediately, tiny blisters should appear.
Turn tortilla and immediately start pressing a wide spatula directly on top of it-- press gently but firmly all over the top.
Blisters will form over most of surface as you press.
Turn tortilla and press all over other side until bilsters turn a golden brown; tortilla should remain soft.
If tortillas stick or brown too quickly, reduce heat.
Stack tortillas as cooked inside a folded cloth towel within a plastic bag; close bag and let tortillas steam and soften until all are cooked.
Serve tortillas as soon as they are soft; or cool, remove from bag, wrap in foil, and refrigerate or freeze.

2.
Frost the cupcakes when they are slightly warm.
You will have some extra frosting left, so dont be afraid to pile it on the cupcakes!
3.
Enjoy!

I used So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk (found in the refrigerated section).
If you use a thinner milk, such as rice milk, it may take more time before it cooks down enough.
Use a 1 2 quart slow cooker for this one ( or multiply recipe and use larger one).
You want to reduce the volume by half.
If you use a thinner milk to begin with it will take more time.
So one way to find out the point where youve reduced volume to half is to actually put the milk into a measuring cup about half way through the process.
After 4 hours on high I poured mine in the measuring cup to check and it had reduced to 1 1/2 cups, after 2 more hours it was a little over 1 cup.
Being coconut milk the solids were perfect.
I havent tested this with any other milk yet, so please let me know if you do.
Now go out and veganize some of your childhood favorites, and let me know how it goes!

Yesterday we introduced the members of Recipe-a-Day to Soda Bread as prepared in cake form.
Today is the same recipe, but prepared as the farl.
This type of preparation is found more often in Northern Ireland and served as a part of a traditional Irish Breakfast, or possibly Ulster Fry is you prefer.
Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to make sure the bicarbonate of soda is proportionately distributed.
Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the buttermilk into the center and start stirring.
Continue to mix till you achieve a dough which is raggy and very soft.
Add in more buttermilk sparingly is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly impact the mix.
Blend quickly, but not too energetically till the whole mass of dough has become a floury, raggy consistency.
Turn the contents of the bowl out onto a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread.
Your primary concern is speed in kneading.
The chemical reaction of the bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet.
You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running high, so do not over knead.
Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in diameter.
Cut the circle of dough into four equal sections and try not to crush or possibly compress the dough when you make the cuts.
A clean slicing motion with a sharp knife is required.
To complete the farl prepare your best cast iron griddle or possibly fry pan for cooking.
Pre-heat the pan over a medium-low setting.
Dust a warm griddle or possibly frying pan with a little flour, and place the farl or possibly farls gently on the warm griddle.
The cut edges should be 1/2 inch or possibly so apart to allow for expansion during cooking.
Grill or possibly fry the farls about 20-min on each side till well toasted in color.
The farls will scorch easily, so keep an eye on the heat and adjust accordingly.
The heat source should be very low when the farls are finished.

Frzn berries (no sugar added) may be substituted for fresh.
Thaw and drain before measuring.
For thinner jam, use juice as part of the 2 c berry amount.
You may decrease the amount of sugar, but it will produce a thinner result.
More sugar will make it thicker.
For best results, sugar substitutes are not recommended.
The average refrigerated life of jam is two weeks; up to several months frzn.
They suggest also trying it on ice cream, waffles, French toast, pancakes, or possibly as a filling for layer cakes.
Yum, I think I'll try it out myself now!

Slice the cheese in 1/2 inch thick rounds.
Mix together the oil, oregano, and aji to form a paste.
Spread the paste over the cheese slices.
There is a certain amount of technique to successfully grilling cheese.
An essential is that the grill must be very hot.
To cook directly on the grill, first set the prepared cheese slices out at room temperature for a couple of hours.
As the surface dries out, a hard film starts to form.
This is what will keep you from ending up with a gooey puddle in the bottom of your grill.
If you don't quite feel up to cooking the cheese directly on the grill, you can use a pie plate or aluminum foil.
Cook about three minutes on each side.
Serve hot.



In small bowl, mix all ingredients well.

Cut the butter into 1/2" cubes.
Place the flour, sugar and salt in your food processor.
Pulse to combine.
Add the butter and pulse until chunks the size of a pea remain.
Slowly pour in the water, pulsing just until the dough begins to come together.
It will look like a shaggy mess.
Remove from the bowl and knead lightly one or two times, then pat out flat and cover with plastic wrap.
Chill 2-3 hours before using.
To use: Cut the dough in half, roll out one section at at time.
After you have either fit it into a pie shell, or formed into squares for turnovers, make sure you chill the dough down hard AGAIN.

Use the cornstarch to dust your hands, and roll the mixture into balls.
Refrigerate overnight.
Remove centers from the refrigerator to warm to room temperature before the next steps.
Melt 1 1/2 pounds of chopped chocolate and temper as follows.
If the chocolate is dull, grainy, or blemished, heat to at least 115 degrees.
When the chocolate is nearly melted, stir to complete the melt.
Let the chocolate cool to 100 degrees.
Look at the chunk of solid chocolate- it should be smooth, dark, and glossy, without dullness or streaking.
Submerge the 6 ounces of solid chocolate in the melted chocolate and stir until the chocolate cools to 90 degrees.
What this process does is isomerize the chocolate as it cools, so that the cooled shells will stay glossy and smooth, even in the refrigerator.
If the solid chunk is dull, streaky, or grained, it will have the opposite effect.
The taste will be the same, but tempering the chocolate makes the truffles much more attractive.
When the chocolate has cooled to 90 degrees, remove the chunk and save it for the next time you temper chocolate.
Smear a thin sample of the melted chocolate on wax paper and refrigerate for 2 minutes.
The smear should cool glossy and smooth, and should break with a snap.
Dip each truffle in chocolate; two forks seem to work the best for this (although I'd be interested in hearing anyone else's idea).
Top the truffles with cocoa or nuts if desired; if you plan to do this, do each truffle as you dip them, because they solidify fairly quickly.
Refrigerate until set.

Heat milk in a sauce pan over medium high heat (any milk - skim, 2%, whole -- it all works just fine!).
Do NOT boil -- just heat thoroughly.
Wisk in vanilla and Nesquik chocolate powder.
I recommend 6 heaping spoonfuls of chocolate powder -- even more if you are a chocolate fan.
Don't be stingy -- it's chocolate!
Now put a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream in the bottom of a mug (about a 4th of a cup).
Poor your hot chocolate mixture over the ice cream.
Start drinking!
The creaminess of the ice cream makes the hot chocolate even more delicious.
You get a little cold with a little hot (fire and ice).
Less chance of the kids burning their tongue on the hot chocolate, too.
Bonus!
I hope you enjoy this yummy treat -- .

Top with 1/3 of the cheese, and continue layering the potatoes and cheese, ending with cheese, and topping each layer with some of the cream remaining in the pan.
Make sure to add enough cream to each layer so that the potatoes are just covered with cream.
(You probably will not use all of the cream remaining in the saucepan.
Discard any remaining cream.)
Place the dish on a baking sheet and roast until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes.



In a large heavy saucepan, combine the white sugar, corn syrup, and salt.
Bring to a boil and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Stir in the butter and heavy cream carefully - the mixture will bubble up.
Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.
Cool slightly before dipping apples or other fruit.



Beat butter at medium speed til light.
Gradually beat in sugar and cream, making 3 additions of sugar and 2 of cream.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.
Serve with assorted fresh vegetables.



Prepare a 7x7 dish by lining it with greaseproof paper for easy removal of the torte once cold.
Measure out the butter and chocolate and chop up ready for adding later.
Put the cream, sugar and salt in a pan and bring slowly to near boiling stirring constantly.
You should see small bubbles at the edges of the pan.
Add the butter and chocolate and stir well until melted.
Then add any other flavourings if desired (eg ginger etc) (optional).
Pour into prepared dish and chill in fridge overnight or until set (at least 7 hours I'd guess).
When set torte can be turned carefully onto serving dish where it will sit firm and not ooze.
You can then decorate with cream / fruit / drizzled white chocolate (optional).



Filling: in a small bowl, combine chocolate chips and strawberry jam.
Set aside.
Batter: in medium bowl, combine dry ingredients.
In large bowl, whisk together sour cream, sugar, butter and eggs until smooth.
Stir in flour mixture until just combined.

Make an indentation in each.
Fill with 1 teaspoon of the chocolate strawberry filling.
Bake at 375 for 22-24 minutes.



You will need a large bread bowl, four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a pastry brush.
Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour.
Stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.Stir in olive oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour.
Mix in remaining flour, a cup at a time, stirring always in the same direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir.
Turn dough out onto a well floured working surface.
Using floured hands, knead gently until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then knead 5 minutes longer.
Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise for 2 to 3 hours.
It will have almost doubled in volume.
Oil two 10 by 15 inch (or larger) baking sheets.
Flatten dough down gently with your hands, then turn out onto floured working surface.
Cut dough in half, return half to the bread bowl and cover.
Divide remaining half in two.
Knead each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your hand.
Let stand five minutes to rest.
Working with each piece in turn, flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide.
It will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
Transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14 inches long.
Let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack at the center of the oven or just above.
(If your baking sheets do not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two racks in oven, one just above the center and one just below.
One bread can go on each rack; about halfway through baking (after 10 to 12 minutes), switch the two around.)
Just before placing in the oven, use a sharp knife or razor blade to make cuts through the breads: Starting two inches from the top and about an inch from the side, cut across the bread to within an inch of the other side.
Make two more cuts, parallel to the first, at about 2 inch intervals (the cuts should go all the way through the dough).
The dough will separate at each cut, so that the bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder; you can pull dough apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits gape more.
Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over, place in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes.
Breads will be golden when done.
Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets, then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps required to form loaves.
Breads should almost have finished rising by the time the first batch comes out of the oven.



In a small bowl, stir the sugar into the lukewarm water.
Stir in the yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Using a standing mixer, combine the flour, salt and pepper.
Add the yeast mixture, olive oil and 1 c water and mix until the dough comes together.
Turn out the dough onto a work suface and knead, adding more water if necessary until the dough is smooth, about 5 minutes.
Return the dough to the bowl, cover and let stand until doubled in size, 45 min to 1 hour.
Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Turn the dough out on the work surface and cut into 4 equal pieces.
Cover 3 pieces with plastic wrap.
Sprinkle 1/4 c grated parmesan onto the work surface.
Roll out 1 piece of dough, flipping once or twice, into an 8 x 24 inch rectangle; pat 1 cup shredded parmesan into the top of the dough.
Cut in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2 inch wide strips.
Transfer the strips to the prepared baking sheet, stretching each slightly.
Repeat with another piece of dough.
Bake for 15 minutes, switch and rotate the pans, then bake until the crackers are golden, about 12 minutes more.
Using a spatula, transfer to a rack to cool.
Repeat with the remaining dough and cheese.

For Large Chocolate Curls:
Melt the chocolate over low heat.
Spread it out in a thin sheet on a flat surface-but not so thin that you can see the surface through the chocolate.
If you have a marble slab, use it.
If not, use a baking sheet.
Let the chocolate cool.
Using a bakers bench scraper or a wide, flat metal spatula, scrape up the chocolate into wide curls, lifting them up as you work.
The curls will be different widths and lengths, but thats fine.
If the chocolate curls up into one long sheet, let it cool more before scraping again.
Carefully place the curls where you want them on the cake.
If you are decorating the side of the cake with them, press the curls gently into the frosting with your fingers so they stay, without falling off.
For Smaller Chocolate Curls:
Buy a thick bar of chocolate and use at room temperature (not straight from the refrigerator).
Stand up the chocolate bar vertically, slightly on an angle, against a flat surface, such as a chopping board.
Slowly scrape down the bar with a vegetable peeler, allowing the chocolate to fall away into a pile of soft curls.

Cut the links apart with a pair of scissors and place in a cold cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
Add 1-2 tablespoons of water and cover (preferably with a heatproof glass lid, so you can watch the progress); simmer for 3-5 minutes or til the sausages start to soften a little.
(Note: Start with one tablespoon of water and add more only if needed.
You just want enough water in there to create adequate steam and give the sausages time to simmer -- don't put too much water in there or you'll wind up boiling them.
).
Remove cover and, using two forks (use one to gently hold the sausages in place so they don't roll and one to poke them), quickly poke each sausage link 4 times.
Poke them crosswise, evenly down the length of the sausage -- like this: __:__:__:__:__ Immediately after finishing poking all the sausages, flip them all over and repeat on the other side.
Cover and simmer for approximately 5 minutes or til the juices run clear.
The water should be mostly gone by this point, but there should still be a little left in there.
Remove the cover and continue cooking to brown the sausages to desired doneness.
I like my with just a little crust to them, but not overdone.
Serve and enjoy!

First, dissolve the yeast in the water in a glass measuring cup.
Once its all dissolved, pour it into a mixing bowl (I use my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook, but you could do it all by hand, of course).
Add the honey, butter, and yogurt and mix till combined.
Add the flours and salt and mix till combined, then knead until it forms into a nice ball.
You may need to add more flour if the dough is still really sticky.
I usually knead it (or let the machine knead it) for about 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove dough from mixing bowl and place into a greased or floured bowl.
Cover with a damp cloth or greased plastic wrap.
Let the dough rise for an hour or more or until doubled in bulk.
Punch down and let rise again for another 15 minutes or so.
You can repeat the punching down and letting rise for 15 minutes a few times if you want.
(The more you do this, the lighter the bread will be.)
Knead and shape the dough into a loaf shape and place in a well-greased loaf pan.
Let rise until doubled, or until it reaches desired height, usually about another hour.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until medium dark brown.

When it comes together, take it out of the bowl and knead well with your hands.
When the dough has formed a smooth, shiny ball, round it off, put it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place (1st rising).
When the dough is 2 to 3 times its original volume, the 1st rising is done.
Take the dough out onto a work surface, divide into 5 portions and round off each.
Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest for 10 minutes.

Cook this while whisking until the flour slightly changes color (whisk constantly so it doesn't burn, and make sure it doesn't burn).
Add the cream slowly, whisking in between each addition so that the lumps come out and the roux stays smooth.
This mixture should always come back to a boil once the milk has been stirred in well, if it doesn't, turn the heat up!
When all the cream has been added and the roux is thick and smooth (about the consistency of thick pudding) add it to the soup.
Stir the soup well to incorporate the cream, and keep stirring until it comes up to a boil.
Add the cheese, turn the heat down to low, cover and bring to a slow boil.
Stir frequently so it doesn't burn on the bottom.

In blender, process butter and olive oil until soft, creamy and smooth.
Turn out (using a soft spatula) into plastic container with lid and refrigerate until set.
*Helpful Hints: I usually double this recipe as it lasts long in the refrigerator.
Choose an olive oil that has no perceptible taste (the green one is stronger tasting), so that it doesn't overpower the taste of the butter.
If per chance the olive oil overpowers the butter taste, then use that Healthy Butter for frying and cooking.
Now here is the thing: It really depends on your butter, however, the brand that I use now requires 2 sticks of butter and only one cup (250 mL) of olive oil.
A little bit of trial and error will find your perfect Healthy Butter Recipe!
My family will not do without it!

The water in the bottom of a double boiler is brought to a boil and then removed from the heat.
The water should be 140F (60C).
Add some finely chopped chocolate, approximately 1/4th of it at a time until you have put the full pound into the top of the boiler.
Stir vigorously as you slowly add the chocolate.
The temperature of the chocolate should not rise above 110F.
When chocolate is completely melted, replace the wter in the double boiler with cold water that is 65F (18C).
The chocolate must be vigorously stirred again to help it cool.
Once the chocolate has dropped to 85F (29C), replace the cold water with lukewarm water that is 100F (37C).
The chocolate should now reach a temperature of 89F (31C) and never any higher.
The bottom of the double boiler is now filled with water that is 90F (32C) to hold the chocolate at the proper temperature for molding and dipping.



Measure out the flour, dry yeast, sugar, salt and skim milk powder, and combine in a bowl.
Make a well in the middle of the flour, and add 90% of the lukewarm water.
The water should not be hot to the touch, or the yeast will die.
Mix the contents of the bowl.
If you cover your hands with plastic gloves the dough won't stick to them.
If the dough is too stiff, add the rest of the lukewarm water.
It can be on the stiff side.
Mix in the olive oil.
Knead the dough until it cleanly comes off the sides of the bowl (about 5 minutes).
Knead the dough on a work surface.
I use a thick (3 mm) vinyl sheet as a kneading surface.
Fold the dough towards you as you knead.
Knead, or bash the dough on the work surface (it's great for releasing stress).
Get rid of your stress for 20 minutes.
When the dough is silky smooth and bouncy, the kneading is done.
Leave to rise (1st rising) in a 37C oven for about 1 hour.
When the dough has about doubled in volume, the 1st rising is done.
The rising time will vary depending on the season (temperature, humidity).
It should double approximately in volume.
Poke the dough with your index finger, to make sure the hole doesn't fill back up.
Apparently this is called the "finger test".
If the hole fills up, let the dough rise a bit more.
Cut the dough into 4 portions with a pastry scraper (or a knife).
Round off each portion of dough, so that they have a smooth, taut surface (rather like steamed buns).
Roll the dough balls on a work surface to make their surfaces really smooth.
(This is a key point) Rest the dough in the refrigerator.
Wrap each ball of dough in plastic wrap, and rest for at least 2 hours (or up to half a day).
Even in the refrigerator, the dough will rise in residual heat.
Press down lightly to deflate the dough, and round off the dough again using bread flour (not listed) to dust your work surface.
Press each dough ball out with the fat part of your palm into a circle.
Since the dough has rested in the refrigerator, it will be very easy to flatten.
You can flatten it to about 7-8 mm in thickness just using your hands, but use a rolling pin to make it about 5 mm thick.
Make sure to keep the dough circular.
Cover the dough circle with one of the pieces of plastic wrap you used to wrap the balls.
Stroke with your hands to shape and smooth out the dough.
Poke several holes in the dough with a fork to finish.
Stab it repeatedly, but gently!
The basic pizza crust is done.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the sugar to a light amber color.
(Check the color by drizzling some onto a white plate.)
Dont worry if the sugar hardens while cooking; simply stir it and continue cooking until it smooths out.
Add the blueberries and 1/2 cup water to the caramel; be careful, as the caramel will bubble and steam a great deal.
Stir the blueberries into the caramel as well as possible (the sauce will harden when the cold blueberries are added, but will loosen up again as the blueberries heat up).
Cover the pan and reduce the heat to low.
Allow the sauce to simmer with the lid on until most of the blueberries have popped and are exuding their juices, about 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and stir the sauce to further dissolve any hardened bits of caramel.
(Dont worry if there are some lumps; they will be strained out.)
Strain the sauce to remove any blueberry skins, seeds, and hard pieces of caramel.
Add the lime juice and return to a saucepan.
Cook further over medium heat until the sauce can be spooned onto a room-temperature plate and keep its shape without being too runny.

Prepare a fire in a grill with the grilling rack set 16 inches above the coals (see Note).
In a saucepan, mix together the vinegar, remaining tablespoon salt, peanut oil, Tabasco sauce, black pepper, 1/4 cup water, and the cayenne.
Bring this mixture to a boil, stir well, and remove from the heat.
When the coals are uniformly covered with gray ash, spread them in a single layer.
Drain the chicken, pat dry, and place the halves on the grill, skin side up.
Baste with the sauce and cook for 30 minutes.
Using tongs, turn the chickens skin side down and baste the top with sauce.
Continue to grill the chickens for an additional 1 1/2 hours, turning and basting the chicken every 15 minutes.
Add charcoal as needed to maintain a hot layer of coals.
Check for doneness by twisting a drumstick.
It should move easily.
If you cannot find small chickens, use larger ones (33 1/2 pounds) and quarter them.
If the grill rack cannot be adjusted, cook the chickens closer to the coals and turn the halves more often to avoid burning.



Whisk together garlic, olive oil, tequila, lime juice, salt, cumin and black pepper.
Place flank steak in zip lock bag and pour in marinade.

Drizzle 1 teaspoons of the olive oil into a non-stick pan and cook the onions over medium heat for a few minutes until they begin to soften,.
Drizzle the other half of the oil into the pan and add the mushrooms; cook on medium, turning and stirring frequently, for a few minutes until the mushrooms soften and begin to release their liquid.
(Optional Step: While the onion and mushrooms are cooking, put dried thyme, garlic powder, and black pepper in a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine consistency.
).
Remove onion and mushrooms from pan and set aside.
Put ground turkey into the same pan, breaking apart the chunks into "ground meat" consistency.
Cook, stirring frequently, until little or no pink shows.
Return onion and mushrooms to pan, and add dried spices, cook on low heat, stirring often, until all the meat is done and the mushrooms and onions have released all their liquid and are beginning to caramelize.
Adjust seasoning, if needed, and add water if the mixture is sticking to the pan too much.
Continue cooking until the meat and vegetable mixture is no longer "wet.
".
Using the spatula, loosen any stuck-on bits on the bottom of the pan, and add the sour cream, mixing well.
Serve immediately over zucchini ribbons, spaghetti squash, or your choice of starch.
On the MediFast plan, this meal would serve two.
On a regular plan, it would serve 3-4.



Scottish Shortbread: As far as shortbread is concerned, I'm a great believer in simplicity.
The recipe for Balmoral Shortbread below is typical of this style.
However, with Scots cookery, one should never ignore Mistress Margaret
(Meg) Dods.
Her "Cook's and Housewife's Manual" was promoted (ghosted) by Sir Walter Scott, who coined her pseudonym.
The recipe for Petticoat Tails is described by Catherine Brown (Scottish Regional Recipes) as "a ladies' shortbread - men generally prefer thick fingers".
Other recipes call for additions such as rice flour, cornflour
(cornstarch), lemon peel, grnd or possibly slivered almonds (or possibly almond essence)
but these are all just curlicues.
As for the commercially produced Choc Chip Shortbread and Cherry Shortbread ... they are about as Scots as the Taj Mahal.
Note the 3:2:1 ratio - what could be simpler.
Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas 4
Sift flour onto a board.
Put sugar in a separate pile on the board, and work in butter.
Gradually knead in flour: you should end up with a hard dough.
Flour the board and roll to a thickness of 3mm to 5mm.
Cut into circles and prick with a fork.
Bake on a greased tray for 30 min.
/COOKIES



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Melt the mint chocolate chips in a double boiler.
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar.
Blend in the melted chocolate.
Add the corn syrup.
Sift and gradually add the dry ingredients.
Roll into one inch balls and dip tops in white sugar.
Place 3 inches apart on greased cookie sheet.
Bake about 8 minutes.
Watch as they burn easily.



Pour milk into a microwave safe mug and place into microwave.
Cook on High until the milk is very hot and begins to foam, about 3 minutes.
Stir in honey and vanilla, then sprinkle with cinnamon before serving.



1.
Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and stir over low heat until blended.
2.
You can use the sauce as a marinade or for basting.
Just remember that you should reserve a portion for the basting and dont re-use marinade once youve had raw meat in it.
3.
Sauce will keep in the fridge for about a week.
I didnt re-heat it before basting it on the meat so its fine to use it right out of the fridge.



Put the blueberries, almonds and honey into a blender.
Blend on high until the mixture is mostly smooth, about 1 minute.
Add the ice cubes and almond milk and blend until very smooth.
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cold water if needed to adjust consistency.
Pour into a glass and garnish with a short skewer of blueberries.



Bring butter to room temperature.
Rub the excess salt off from the sakura flowers and chop it up finely.
Cream the butter with a whisk, then add the sugar in 4 goes and whisk until it becomes fluffy.
Then add beaten egg in 3 parts and mix.
Add the chopped sakura flowers and the vanilla oil and mix.
Then add the rice flour in 4 portions and fold in after each addition using a rubber spatula.
Dust a flat surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it.
Dust the surface of the dough as well and roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is about 3 mm thick.
Wrap the dough with a plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Use your favorite cookie cutter to cut out the shapes.
Put the dough back into the refrigerator if the dough becomes too soft.
When you push the dough out of the cookie cutter, make sure to clean away any left over dough.
If you dust the inside of the cutter with flour as well the cookies will come out cleanly every time.
Line on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper with some space in between, and bake in an oven preheated to 170C for 15 to 20 minutes.
Once the cookies are cool enough to touch, transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container.
I used fine rice flour for this recipe which can be found in the baking corners of most supermarkets.
You can't substitute joshinko as it is too coarse.

Make the salt water.
Warm up 90 ml of water just enough that the salt will dissolve in it easily.
Dissolve the salt in it, and leave the water to cool down to room temperature.
(10 g of salt is 2 teaspoons)
Combine the flours in a bowl.
Add the salt water to this little by little while you mix it into the flours.
(Don't worry if it looks like there's not enough water in the dough at this stage.)
Form the dough into a ball, cover completely with plastic wrap, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
(The flour will become permeated with the moisture in the dough as it rests.)
Put the dough in a doubled up thick plastic bag (or two plastic bags).
Step on the dough evenly, starting from the middle and working towards the edges.
When the dough is flat, take it out of the bag, fold up up into a small bundle again, return to the bag and step on it until it's flattened.
Repeat about 5 more times.
If you have the time, keep folding and stepping on it again and again.
Step on it with your kids, step on it with your hubby, step on it with your lover.
When you've stepped on it as much was you want, roll the dough up, wrap it in plastic and rest it for 30 minutes to an hour.
(You can skip this resting step, but it's better if you don't.)
After the dough has rested, flour a cutting board and roll the dough out very very thinly with a rolling pin.
Dust with more flour and fold the dough, and slice it into noodles from the edge.
Separate the cut noodles as you dust it with more flour.
Boil the udon noodles in plenty of water.
(If you're serving them cold, cook for a slightly longer time.)
Rinse the cooked noodles well in cold water until the surface stickiness is gone.
Serve with toppings of your choice.

Before starting I highly suggest that you prep and measure out all of your ingredients.
This will make everything so much easier.
I promise!
1.
In a medium saucepan, add the sugar and heat on medium-high.
Using a spatula or whisk, stir the sugar until a crumbly mixture starts to form (about 7 minutes).
Continue stirring until the sugar melts completely and is a dark amber color (about 3-5 minutes).
2.
Add the slices of butter to the saucepan.
The butter may sizzle a bit, but this is completely normal.
Continue to stir until all the butter is melted.
3.
Slowly pour the heavy cream into the mixture and continue stirring.
4.
Once the heavy cream is fully incorporated, allow the mixture to boil for about 1-2 minutes.
The mixture will bubble and will rise in the saucepan (this helps create a thick caramel sauce).
5.
Remove the saucepan from the heat and mix in the sea salt.
Allow caramel to cool and pour into an airtight container.
Stays good in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
Notes: Depending on your stove (I have an electric stove), your mixture might need more or less time to melt or boil the ingredients.
Just make sure that everything is melted and incorporated prior to moving to the next step.



In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda.
Add the water and the 2 teaspoons of oil and stir gently with a wooden spoon until thoroughly blended.
Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
In a medium saucepan, heat 1 inch of oil to 350.
Using well-oiled hands, roll tablespoon-size pieces of the dough about 3 inches long, then flatten them slightly and drop into the hot oil.
If the dough sticks to your hands, just peel it off; don't worry about the shape.
Fry 3 or 4 fritters at a time until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fritters to a rack set over a baking sheet to drain.
Adjust the heat if necessary to maintain 350.
Serve immediately.



In a small bowl stir together the butter and the oil.
In a food processor fitted with a 1-millimeter slicing blade or with a mandoline or similar hand-held slicing device, slice the potatoes thin.
Working quickly to prevent the potatoes from discoloring, brush the bottom of a 9-inch cast-iron skillet with some of the butter mixture and cover it with a layer of the potato slices, overlapping them.
Brush the potatoes with some of the remaining butter mixture, sprinkle them with some of the rosemary, and season them with salt and pepper.
Layer the remaining potatoes with the remaining butter mixture and the rosemary in the same manner.
Heat the mixture over moderately high heat until it begins to sizzle, transfer the skillet to the middle of a preheated 450F oven, and bake the galette for 25 minutes, or until it is golden and the potatoes are tender.
Cut the galette into wedges.

Add powdered sugar to the softened butter (I microwave it for 20 seconds to soften) and mix well with a whisk.
If using unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt.
Add flour (no sifting needed) and mix with the whisk.
Knead the mixture until it's no longer floury.
Don't worry if it is rough and crumbly at first, it will be smooth shortly.
Tear the dough, flatten each piece to a 1cm thickness and place on a baking pan.
Poke holes with a fork.
The dough will increase to 1.5 times its original size.
Bake in a 355F/180C oven for 10 minutes, then flip the baking tray around and bake for a further 3 minutes (adjust the cooking time accordingly) to bake evenly.
Pay attention to the color on the edges.
No matter how long you have been baking them, take the cookies out of the oven once they become light brown on the edges.
Cool on the baking pan (they will continue to cook from the residual heat), and they are done.
Here, I shaped the dough into a square log in plastic film and sliced it to make them like English style shortbread cookies.
The dough can be cut with a knife easily even at room temperature.
It is very easy to handle, so it's great to make cut-out cookies.
They are also delicious with chocolate chips added to the dough.
Add the same amount as the sugar.
Try them also with cocoa or coffee.

In my recipes for ice cream and sorbets, I use the word about when indicating the quantity the recipe will make.
In general, a custard or other mixture frozen in an ice cream machine designed for home use will increase in volume by around 25 percent once churned.
The air incorporated into ice cream during churning, by the way, is called the overrun, and commercial ice cream can have up to 120 percent overrun!
Most of the recipes in this book will make 1 quart (1 liter) of frozen ice cream or sorbet.
I tested the recipes using two of the most commonly used types of machinesone with a canister that you prefreeze and the other a powerful, self-refrigerated model.
I found that the ice cream increased in volume in proportion to the power and speed of the machine.
Hence, the recipes may yield slightly more or slightly less for you.

In a large bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, and table salt.
Add the olive oil and 1/2 cup water to the flour; stir with a rubber spatula until it collects into a soft, crumbly ball of dough.
Use the spatula or your hands to press the dough against the sides of the bowl to gather all the stray flour.
Set the dough on a lightly floured work surface and portion it into thirds.
Pat each portion into a square.
Set two squares aside and cover with a clean towel.
Roll the remaining dough into a rectangle about 1/16 inch thick and 7 or 8 inches wide by 14 or 15 inches long.
Whenever you feel resistance, lift up one edge of the dough and sprinkle more flour underneath before you continue rolling.
With a pastry brush, brush the dough lightly with water and sprinkle about a third of the seed mix evenly over the surface.
Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoons of the kosher salt.
With a dough scraper, pizza cutter, ravioli cutter, or sharp knife, cut the dough in half lengthwise and then cut across to make rectangles roughly 2 by 4 inches.
Dont bother trimming the edges; rustic edges add character.
Transfer to an unlined baking sheet.
Bake until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.
Let cool on a wire rack.
While each batch is baking, clean your work surface as needed and repeat the rolling and cutting with the remaining portions of dough.

Preparation: coarsely chop the walnuts and roast them in a skillet over low heat until they start making crackling noises.
Place all ingredients except the walnuts into a bread machine, select the dough cycle and press start, allowing the machine to do its job until the first rising.
Add the walnuts in the case inside the machine designated for toppings and additions.
When the cycle completes, take the dough out to a working surface, punch it down to let the trapped air out, divide the dough into 4 and roll into balls.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth, and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Punch down again to let the air out and roll out the dough to 20 cm in length.

If you have the time, lightly toast the sesame seeds and allow to cool then proceed.
If pressed for time, bypass the toasting.
In food processor or blender combine all *ingredients and blend until relatively smooth.
Add more oil if necessary to aid in blending.
There definitely will be whole seeds remaining no matter how well you blend, and that's okay.
Mixture will be very oily and not very smooth.
(Remember, this is an emergency!)
;).
If time permits, allow tahini to set for 30 minutes.
NOTE: If you don't have any time available to toast or blend the seeds then omit those steps and add the whole seeds and oil directly into your recipe, depending of course on what you are preparing.
It's a judgment call.
Very important to be sure your sesame seeds are fresh before starting this recipe!
If not, your tahini will taste rancid.
ALWAYS keep sesame seeds refrigerated!
Refrigerate any leftover tahini.
*Bear in mind that my measurements are approximated.
Adjust amounts accordingly.



Refer to Recipe #309834 for instructions to prepare the dough necessary to make the pitas.
TO BAKE: (Dough should be refrigerated for at least 24 hours).
Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500 degrees with a baking stone.
Just before baking, dust a pizza peel with flour.
With wet hands, pull up one end of the refrigerated dough (Recipe #309834).
Using a serrated knife, cut off a 1-pound, or grapefruit-size, piece of dough.
(Note a 1 pound piece of dough will make 4 pitas so adjust the amount needed as necessary.)
Divide the dough into 4 pieces (no larger than 4 ozs.
each) and shape into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four side, rotating a quarter-turn as you go.
Place the dough on a flour-dusted pizza peel, dusting the top with flour.
With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into rounds with a uniform thickness of 1/8 inch.
This is important, because if it's too think, it may not puff.
With a quick motion, slide the pitas from the pizza peel directly onto the preheated baking stone.

In a microwave safe dish (I used a Pyrex pie plate), place the nuts evenly in a single layer (coat them in the fat, if using).
Microwave on HIGH heat for 2 minutes, stir, and continue to cook and stir at one minute intervals, until nuts are fragrant and light golden brown in color.
Be careful not to let them scorch.
Use potholders.
(Note: total cook time is about 5 minutes for whole nuts-- smaller amounts or sliced nuts or sesame seeds could be done in as little as 2 minutes, larger amounts of nuts will take longer and not cook as evenly, therefore 1/2 cup of nuts is optimal for even cooking.
The optional addition of the fat will speed cooking time somewhat).
IMPORTANT SAFETY TIPS: Be sure to use potholders as the dish will become hot.
Do NOT add water to the hot dish, as it may crack.
Microwave heating times vary, so use caution.
Let cool at room temperature.
Use in recipes or for snacking.

"NOTE: Do Not Use Light cream cheese or Butter substitute.
IF Margarine is used icing will be softer."
This recipe states the yield as 2-3/4 cups.
Personal note: I used a Cream Cheese Frosting recipe with the I BELIEVE to be the same ingredients on this site that had been adopted or listed as one's own.
Because it was not specified to use Full Fat Cream Cheese....I used light cream cheese....this resulted in having to add more than double the amount of Powdered Sugar listed to get a proper icing consistency.
I used no liquids except for the stated 1 tsp Vanilla.
My climate is desert arrid...so moisture in the air was not the issue.
I thought my icing was terrible.
I have listed this recipe off the box, almost verbatim.
I take no credit for this recipe.
My notes are mine, I stand firm on those.

Combine the yeast, warm water, and the 1/2 teaspoon of sugar or honey.
Let it stand until it is fully dissolved.
It should divide (watching yeast grow is cool!)
and look frothy.
Add the oil, sugar, salt, and malt syrup.
Since I use turbinado sugar or honey, I try to make sure the sugar is dissolved or the honey melted through before I add flour.
Slowly add the flour (about one cup at a time) mixing well between each addition.
Use your hands to mix it once it gets stiff, if you want.
I like getting elbow deep when I make bread.
In higher elevations, it takes seven cups of flour.
The bread should feel smooth and velvety.
Knead the dough for 6-8 minutes (in higher elevations, it definitely takes the full 8).
The dough should be firm, but soft.
When you poke at it, it slowly regains its shape, but is still dented.
Shape the dough into a ball.
Put it in a well greased bowl and cover it.
I like to put the bowl in a plastic bag and then throw a towel over the top.
Let it rise until doubled in bulk.
This should be around 45 minutes.
Again, for anyone else in higher elevations, we have to change it.
This bread does better if you coat your hands in oil and lightly coat the top of the bread.
Also, it takes more like an hour to rise.
Punch the dough.
Shape it however you like.
The recipe calls for three balls placed in a 12x5 inch pan together, or side by side on a baking sheet.
This bread works well for hamburger buns, meat pastie rolls, just about anything, so have fun!
Just make sure to coat the pan with oil, or use parchment paper on a baking sheet.
Let rise again until doubled.
Same thing - cover the bowl in a plastic bag and a towel and let it be.
This takes 45 minutes in higher elevations, probably closer to half an hour at lower elevations.
Preheat oven to 375 f.
Remove bread from the plastic and bake for 30-35 minutes.

Measure water into a pan that has a tight fitting lid, cover and turn on high.
When water begins to boil - add salt, cover and return lid giving just a moment or two to return to a full rolling boil.
Proceed with whatever recipe you have that says cook in "boiling salted water".
Adjust water amounts according to amount of your recipe yield, keeping the water/salt ratio of 1 tsp salt to 1 cup water.
TIPS:.
Placing a lid on pan will help water to boil faster.
ALWAYS add salt AFTER the water is boiling to prevent "pitting" of your pans, which can ruin a pan forever.
NOTE:.
After reading my first review,.
I do want to explain I am NOT in ANYWAY picking fun at new cooks, everyone starts somewhere.
The humor I found in the recipe listing at another site is the reviews so many people wrote in reply to reading the recipe.
736 reviews!
Almost 90% are written in a good cooks humor.
When I was done reading all I could handle, my sides ached, my cheeks were wet with tears of insane laughter, and I had called long distance to 2 sisters, making them listen!
At the risk of being hit by the large Zaar spoon, I will just say the other recipe site starts with an E. (Please note: that is the only recipe I suggest for reading there!
And 'Zaar is the ONLY www.
site that I have a paid membership!)
:).

Place potatoes on a baking sheet.
(I line mine with parchment paper for easy clean up I am lazy like that!)
4.
Drizzle olive oil over potatoes.
Try to cover them as much as possible but you dont want to have them sitting in big puddles of oil either.
5.
Sprinkle seasoned salt all over the potatoes.
6.
Finish with a little salt and pepper.
7.
Place in oven for 20 30 minutes.
You are looking for the largest of the potatoes to be fork tender.
8.
Remove from oven and serve next to your favorite meat dish.
They look very elegant on your plate but also are kid friendly.
(My crew loves to dip them in sour cream nothing can be for the worse with sour cream on it!)



Melt chocolate and milk over low heat.
Remove from heat.
Stir in powdered sugar, nuts and cherries, mix well.

Mix 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, the bread flour, salt, yeast and 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water (105 degrees F to 110 degrees F) in a large bowl with a wooden spoon to make a wet and sticky dough.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until almost tripled in size, 2 to 3 hours (the top will flatten and begin to sink in the center).
Divide the dough in half and transfer one piece to another bowl.
Cover both bowls with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.
Put a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the highest oven rack and put a broiler pan on the lowest rack; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, sprinkle each piece with 1/4 cup flour, then shape each into a smooth, taut ball.
Cover the bowls loosely with plastic wrap; refrigerate 30 minutes.
Put a large piece of parchment paper on a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet and dust with flour.
Using floured hands, pick up a ball of dough and poke your thumbs through the center to make a hole.
Place on the parchment, then gently stretch the dough from the center to make a 9-inch-diameter ring with a 5-inch hole in the center.
Sprinkle generously with flour.
Lay out another sheet of parchment, dust with flour and repeat to shape the other ball of dough into a ring.
Let rest, uncovered, 15 minutes.
Holding kitchen shears at a 45 degrees F angle, make deep cuts at 1-to-1 1/2-inch intervals all the way around both dough rings, pulling the cut sections away from the center as you go to make "leaves."
Let rest, uncovered, until plump, about 15 more minutes.
Slide one dough wreath (on the parchment) directly onto the hot stone.
Carefully pour 1 cup water into the broiler pan underneath to create steam; quickly shut the oven door.
Bake until the bread is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer to a rack to cool.
Repeat with the second dough wreath, adding another cup of water to the broiler pan.
MAKE IT AHEAD Cool the bread completely, then wrap tightly in foil and freeze for up to 5 days.
Reheat, wrapped, at 450 degrees F until warmed through, 20 to 25 minutes.

Trim off the tough bottom of the spear by grasping each end and bending it gently until it snaps at its natural point of tendernessusually two-thirds of the way down the spear.
If the spear is less than 6 inches long, chances are it has already been trimmed for you.
Alternatively, you can cut the ends off with a knife.
Coat each spear with olive oil by placing clean, dry spears in a resealable plastic bag, pour in the oil, and massage spears to coat each one.
Sprinkle with salt and massage again.
Leave the asparagus in the bag until ready to cook.
Place on the cooking grate crosswise so it won't fall through.
Grill for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the size and thickness of the stalks), turning occasionally to expose all sides to the heat.
Asparagus should begin to brown in spots (indicating that its natural sugars are caramelizing) but should not be allowed to char.
Remove from grill and serve immediatelyeating spears with your fingers enhances the experience.



Place flavored instant coffee in cup or mug.
Stir in hot milk until instant coffee is completely dissolved.
Add toppings; stir until well blended.

Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least two hours before serving.



Wash and husk the strawberries.
In a food processor or blender, mash up the berries to your desired consistency-- sometimes I like a total complete puree, but pulsing a few times until mostly pureed with some fruit chunks still in it is also pretty good.
In a large mixing bowl, dump out the applesauce and mix with the strawberry puree.
Blend in the sugar and lemon juice.
Well-grease a 11x7 baking dish with cooking spray.
Pour the mixture into the dish.
Bake at 250F for 4-5 hours or until set.

Tastes good served immediately, tastes better when allowed to chill overnight.



in bowl, add the milk and protein powder, stil well.
add the cereal and stir.
serve and enjoy!



Spray an 8x8 casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
In a 4 quart sauce pan, melt butter on low heat.
Do this slowly, you dont want burnt or brown butter here.
Once butter has melted, keep heat on low and add mini marshmallows.
Once marshmallows begin to soften and melt, add peanut butter.
At this point, you will need to constantly stir the mixture so the peanut butter does not burn and the marshmallows can evenly melt (wont take too long, about 5 minutes or so).
Once, mixture is combined and melted, turn off heat and remove pan from stove.
Add crisp rice cereal to sauce pan and stir until evenly coated with mixture.
This is sticky stuff so do your best to get it all combined.
Pour mixture into casserole dish (it will look very loose).
Spray your hands with some nonstick cooking spray and pat down the mixture until firmly compacted.
Allow 30-45 minutes for treats to set up...then enjoy!
Cooks Note: You can use a 13x9 dish for this but we prefer a slightly thicker bar so I go with the smaller size.
Also, for all you budget-conscious shoppers, I have made this recipe with the store brand cereal, marshmallows, butter and peanut butter and these treats still turn out delicious.
And if youre a Krispies treats purist (like my hubby), just leave out the peanut butter, theyll still be gooey.



Reheat meatballs in a skillet.
When thoroughly heated, add cooked quinoa and continue to saute to warm through.
When heated, add tomatoes and cheese, toss gently and remove from heat.

Combine all in a tall glass.
Garnish with lemon slice and rose petals.



Combine the ingredients, mixing well.
Transfer the dip to a smaller bowl (which can be your serving bowl); cover tightly with film and refrigerate.
Before serving, stir the dip in the bowl and garnish with a few shakes of paprika, chopped scallion, chopped tomato, etc.--something with lots of color!
Your eyes eat first: spend some time on your vegetable prep.
Choose nice looking ones and cut them into bite-size, easy-to-handle pieces.
Usually, you can cut them the day before and store in food storage bags overnight, being sure to squeeze out as much air as you can.
It really helps!



Blend ingredients except ice in blender until smooth.
Add ice; blend on high speed until thickened.
Serve immediately.



In a large, deep, heavy-duty saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the sugar in an even layer.
Cook the sugar over low to medium heat, watching it carefully.
When it begins to liquefy and darken at the edges, use a heatproof spatula to very gently stir it to encourage even cooking.
Tilt the pan and stir gently until all of the sugar is melted and the caramel begins to smoke and turns a deep amber color.
Immediately remove from the heat and whisk in half of the cream, which will steam and bubble up furiously.
Carefully stir until the sugar is dissolved, then gradually whisk in the remaining cream and the salt and vanilla.
If there are any bits of hardened sugar, whisk the sauce over low heat until smooth.
Serve warm.
This sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Rewarm it gently in a microwave or by stirring in a saucepan over very low heat.
If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it by adding a small amount of milk or additional cream.



Preheat the oven to 450.
In small bowl, mix flour and salt.

In a skillet add all of your ingredients and cook over medium heat stirring occasionally.
Smash down the fruit while stirring.
Cook until thicken and fruit has softened.
Let the fruit cool a bit, then put in a blender and pulse it a couple of times.
(If you want it smooth, puree it longer.)
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Use on toast, pork, chicken or shrimp.



Line a 9 x 13 baking dish with foil.
Grease foil generously.
In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, add corn syrup and sugar.
Cook until mixture comes to a boil.
Let boil for about 5 minutes or until sugar is completely dissolved.
Turn off heat and stir in 1 cup of peanut butter until mixture is smooth.
Mix peanut butter mixture with cereal.
Be sure all the cereal is coated.
Press evenly into prepared baking dish.
In a saucepan, melt chocolate chips with remaining 1/4 cup of peanut butter until smooth.
Spread evenly on top of bars.
Place in fridge for at least 12 hours before serving to let bars set.
Keep leftovers covered in refrigerator.



Culture the cream: pour cream into a container, cover and let sit at room temperature for 2-3 days.
The cream will seperate some, and will sour.
This is a good thing!
Stir the cream to reincorporate the ingredients.
Begin to slowly whip the cream, by hand or using a stand-mixer.
When soft peaks begin to form whip faster.
The butter fat will begin to seperate from the butter milk -- continue to whip until you have pea sized chunks of the butter fat clinging to the side of the bowl.
This step may take some time, but be patient, it will happen!
Line a collander or strainer with cheesecloth and place your butter fat / butter milk into the cheesecloth (make sure to catch the butter milk!
you can use it for pancakes later!
).
Pull the ends of the cheese cloth together and press down to get rid of more of the butter milk.
You should now have a large hunk of very soft butter -- it's still got some butter milk incorporated into it, so --
You now want to rinse the butter under cold running water to remove more of the butter milk -- I do it a small handfull at a time, and I do it over a strainer or collander so I don't lose any small pieces.
It takes some practice, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.
After you've rinsed all the butter, place it in a mixing bowl and begin to press it up against the side of the bowl using a flat spoon or rubber spatula.
You'll release more butter milk and water this way, so make sure to drain that off as you go.
This is also the step where you will add any 'special' ingredients i.e.
salt, lavender, honey, whatever -- I prefer to make it un-salted, but recipezaar won't let me post a recipe with only one ingredient, so I'm listing salt --
when you're done with this step place the butter in some kind of mold (I use a cake pan lined with cheesecloth) and place it in the fridge.
after a few hours the butter will have set and if you want to cut it into smaller pieces you can do so --
This is an incredibly simplified version of the recipe that I use to make the butter that we sell at the shop I work at -- I make approximately double this recipe every week.
It's easy and, actually, kind of fun.
The end product will be much smoother and fresher than any butter you would buy at the store (unless, of course, you're shopping where I work :) .)
Starting with a better product will, of course, yield a better result.
I suggest using raw, organic, unpasteurized cream, if you can get it.
You will be pleasantly surprised with the result, and you will be doing your body, and the local economy, a favor.
A note about culturing -- you can omit this step if you like, but I reccomend trying it at least once.
I think if you do, you'll never go back.
It gives butter a characteristic flavor and a little more 'zing.'
I often have customers questioning this step saying things like "So you just let the milk go BAD?
Isn't that un-healthy?"
I usually try to calm them by pointing out that this has been done for centuries with much success.
A note about temperature -- you will find it very difficult to do this recipe in a hot kitchen.
The butter will melt constantly and you'll lose more in the rinsing process.
At the same time, a cold kitchen will make it difficult as well.
I find that 70 to 75 degrees is the ideal temperature.



Combine green beans, olive oil, garlic, and salt in a bowl; toss to coat.
Allow green beans to marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Arrange green beans on a grill pan.
Place grill pan on preheated grill; cook and stir green beans until lightly charred, about 10 minutes.



Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
Combine the Simply Potatoes mashed potatoes and your mashed butternut squash in a large bowl until thoroughly blended.
Reserve half of the mixture in a smaller bowl.
Returning your focus to the large bowl now containing half of the total mash mix, sift in the flour and baking powder.
Work the dry and wet ingredients together until well combined and a ball of dough forms.
Add flour as necessary in tablespoons to keep it from sticking.
Once you've successfully formed a ball of dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for a few minutes to rest.
Meanwhile: grease a pizza pan or baking sheet and shred your cheese.
Once the dough has rested, roll it to your desired thickness and transfer to your pan, or simply press it into shape on the pan itself.
Set the crust in the oven to pre-bake for about 10 minutes.
Doing this will ensure that your crust cooks through entirely once you add your toppings.
Once pre-baked, remove from the oven and spread with your reserved mashed potato-squash mix.
Top the mix with the cheese, and return your pizza to the oven.
Cook for 8-15 more minutes, or until the crust underneath has cooked through and the cheese is beginning to turn golden.
Note that the exposed crust will not get very brown on top, but that the dough in contact with the pan should turn a light golden brown.



Whisk all ingredients till blended and sugar is dissolved.
Put in a container and keep in refrigerator.
It is better if it ages for about 4 days, but you can use it immediately if you need to (I have).
It will keep about 4-5 months in the refrigerator if it lasts that long.



Preheat oven to 425F.
Toss vegetables with dressing.
Spread evenly into 15x10x1-inch baking pan sprayed with cooking spray.
Bake 45 min.
or until vegetables are tender and golden brown, stirring after 30 min.



Combine sugar, honey and water in a medium saucepan and stir well to mix.
Bring this mixture to a boil (DO NOT STIR, so use a non-stick saucepan).
Once the mixture begins to boil, cook it until it reaches a soft ball stage (240 degrees on a candy thermometer).
Again, DO NOT STIR.
Remove from heat and add flavorings, then stir to blend.
Allow this mixture to cool to a lukewarm temperature.
Once it becomes lukewarm, beat this with a hand mixer until it becomes creamy, about 3 minutes.
Add pecans and stir until they are completely coated.
Drop by heaping teaspoon onto wax paper and cool completely.



Cook rice.
Add butter, cheese and parsley.
Stir.



Make the cupcakes - Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 325F Lightly butter twenty-four 1-3/4" x 3/4" (1-oz) muffin of biscuit cups.
Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.
Mix in the sugar.
Make a well in the center.
Whisk in the water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.
Blend until smooth.
(The batter will be very thin.
).
Spoon the batter into the prepared cups.
Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean, about 12 to 14 minutes.
Cool the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from the pans and finish cooling on the rack.
To Make the filling - In a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream to a boil.
Add the white chocolate and remove from heat.
Let the mixture stand briefly; stir until smooth.
Transfer to a metal bowl and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, stirring occasionally.
(To speed the process, set the metal bowl over a larger bowl of ice water; stir the chocolate mixture until cool.)
With an electric mixer, beat the white chocolate mixture just until fluffy, about 1 minute.
Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain tip.
Insert the pastry tip 1/4-inch into the bottom of each cupcake and squeeze a little filling into each one.
To Make the glaze - Place the chocolate in a small bowl.
Whisk in the boiling water and blend until smooth.
One at a time, dip the top of each cupcake into the warm glaze.
Turn the glazed cupcakes right side up and set them on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.
Refrigerate the cupcakes for 5 minutes to set the glaze.
To Make the icing - In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy.
Stir in the cream of tartar.
Gradually mix in enough of the confectioner's sugar to make a fairly stiff and smooth icing.
Fill a small paper cone with the icing and cut a 1/16-inch opening at the tip.
Remove the cupcakes from the refrigerator.
Pipe a design (a squiggle, spiral, etc.)
on the top of each cupcake.
Let the design harden and then cover and refrigerate the cupcakes.
Serve at room temperature.
The cupcakes can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or frozen up to 2 weeks.



Spread the pork rinds out in a large baking dish.
In a small bowl, stir together the cinnamon and sweetener.
Drizzle melted butter over the pork rinds while shaking the dish to evenly distribute the butter on all sides of the rinds.
Sprinkle with the cinnamon and sweetener, stirring to coat.



Preheat the oven to 425F Place the asparagus in a shallow baking dish.

In a non-reactive container (e.g., a qt-size plastic peanut butter or possibly mayonaise jar with a plastic lid) mix together all ingredients.
Cap loosely to keep the fruit flies out and leave at room temperature for about 5 days, stirring gently each day.
It will develop a nice yeasty, beery aroma.
After 5 days, feed it as below, or possibly if you aren't going to use it, screw the cap on and chill.
About 12 hrs before you use it, add in 1 c. each of water and flour.
It will foam up quite nicely after about12 hrs or possibly so; take out the amount you need for the recipe and close the lid on the rest and chill.
The next time you are ready to make a sourdough recipe, just take it out, add in the appropriate amount of water and flour at a 1:1 ratio and let set 12 hrs at room temp.
If I go more than 2 or possibly 3 weeks without using the starter (rare indeed), I take it out and feed it anyway and then give the excess to my 2 coon hounds.
[The coon hounds are not necessary to the recipe ::)) ].
Should the starter go off-color or possibly have anything other than a beery, yeasty, sour odor, throw it out and start again.
I have never had this happen to me, but have heard of it.
After initially making the starter, if you need starter in a hurry, use very hot water (100F) when feeding it and it is usually ready in 4 to 6 hrs.
[You can tell; it will be nice and foamy; sometimes after a full 12 hrs, the foam will have subsided a bit, but it is still ready to use - I stir the foam down anyway]

*You can use up to 1/2 cup applesauce if you want a much softer granola bar, or decrease for even more crunch.
Coconut is absolutely optional, but it adds something special to the consistency without drawing attention to itself.
*I really believe this recipe would lend itself well to any whole grain flour.
I've only tried the two listed here, and maybe oat flour once, but I hope to try other flours sometime.
*I can get molasses cheap in bulk, so I use that in this recipe.
The original called for honey, but it's too expensive for me to keep much on hand, and the granola bars made with honey were really bland, even with some vanilla added, so I prefer the molasses.
If you prefer to use honey, just add 1/4 cup, a little vanilla, and substitute 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the white.
Don't use vanilla with the molasses--tastes weird.
Besides, everything is cheaper without vanilla.

This stuff spits grease.
Be happy!
The spitting grease is contained inside the grill and not spattered across your kitchen.

Get the biggest chestnuts possible, because they're easier to peel.
Wash the chestnuts carefully, and throw out any that have been nibbled on by insects.
Cover the chestnuts with boiling water, and leave to soak for several hours (I soaked them for 2 hours this time), or until they have cooled down enough to touch.
I prefer not to boil them.
Remove the outer shell.
Cut into the shell starting from around the border between the rough part on the bottom and the smooth part upwards, then peel off.
If the bottom of the chestnut is flat, start the cut where it begins to curve.
You don't have to remove the whole bottom part of the skin at this point.
It took me about 30 minutes to peel 1 kg of chestnuts.
Soak the peeled chestnuts in water.
Put the chestnuts in a pot with water to cover.
Add baking soda and turn the heat on.
When the water comes to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
The chestnuts shouldn't be bouncing around and bumping into each other in the pot.
The cooking liquid will turn pitch black.
Put the pot in the sink, and leave the water running from the tap in a slow stream near the edge of the pot for 30 minutes.
Don't let the chestnuts roll around in the pot!
A key point!
Using your fingers and a toothpick, remove dirt on the surface of the chestnut, and take off any thick fibers as well as the bottom part that was left earlier.
When the chestnuts are nice and smooth, put them back in a pot full of water.
Even if the skin has ripped a bit, if you handle the chestnuts gently, they'll be fine!
Simmer for another 30 minutes, and then cool in running water again like step 7.
Repeat until the cooking liquid is red, 1 to 2 times.
Put the sugar and chestnuts in a pot with water to cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes.
Leave the chestnuts to cool in the liquid.
The chestnuts can be stored in sterilized jars for a while, or in a plastic container in the refrigerator for a few days.
Any broken ones can be made into a paste and frozen.

Combine the skim lowfat milk, lowfat milk pwdr, cocoa, and sugar in a 3-qt stainless steel saucepan.
Bring to a boil on high heat, stirring constantly.
Lower heat to prevent the mix from boiling over.
Add in the cornstarch mix gradually while stirring at the same time.
When the lowfat milk thickens to the consistency of cake batter, that happens almost immediately, remove and set aside.
(If the lowfat milk does not thicken easily, add in 1 Tbsp.. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp.. cool lowfat milk.)
Stir in the vanilla extract.
Pour the mix into a fancy serving dish and allow to cold.
Chill for at least 3 hrs to enable the pudding to set.
When the pudding feels hard (test by tipping the bowl gently), garnish with cherries or possibly your favorite fat-free topping.
Serve.



In a small bowl, stir together all of the ingredients.
Put into small containers and give away as gifts or keep for yourself.



Heat oven to 450.
Stir together sugar, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt.
Mix lightly with apples.
Pour into pastry-lined pie pan.
Dot with butter.
Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust,.



In a medium bowl, mix crushed wafers and melted butter until well blended .
Press mixture into a 10 inch quiche dish.
Place chocolate and cream in the top of a double boiler.
Heat over low heat, stirring, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.
Pour chocolate into crumb crust and refrigerate 2 hours before serving.



Bring the water and milk to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer.
Add the oats, honey, cinnamon, and salt and cover.
Stir the mixture every 5 minutes or so, to check the water isnt getting to hot and that the oats arent sticking to the bottom.
After about 30 or so minutes, when the mixture is thick and most of the milk and water mix is gone, add the peanut butter and chia seeds and mix in thoroughly.
When the oatmeal is at a consistency you like, pour it into a bowl and top with the melted jam and chopped peanuts.
Remember, this is oatmeal and you can make it anyway you want.
Prefer almond butter?
Go for it!
Want maple syrup instead of honey?
Do it!
Make it your own.
Oh, and if you think you added to much liquid and cant seem to get a thick enough consistency, leave the lid off the pot and it will evaporate instead of the oats having to absorb it.
Enjoy!
